"The purpose of the loan is to pay off current high interest credit cards and pay off my debt.  For the first time in my life, I was unemployed in 2001 (last recession) for 8 months and used credit cards to pay expenses.  I chose not to file bankruptcy as I felt responsible to pay my debts. A few collection accounts (paid) from 2001 adversely affected my credit score for the past 7 years which meant the credit card APR's were high and paying down the debt was difficult.  Despite making more than the minimum payments;  making steady payments; and having a stable job (professional) and residency, my credit card/loan accounts are with the now notable BIG three banks.  In January of 2008, one of the banks raised my APR without providing a reason in writing!  I received a letter, but it only stated my APR would increase.  First I was told it was because of an adverse credit report and when I checked into this, it was not accurate.  Over the course of a year, when I requested to have the rate returned to the previous APR or reduced, the request was refused.  BUT, they were more than willing to offer me a ""great deal"" where they would give me another credit card at a low interest rate!!  I refused and when I did the research, I discovered that this was a new tactic being used where the higher interest credit card account would have been closed and opening another account would have adversely affected my credit score (thus further indebting me to that bank)!!!!  This offer occurred when my credit score improved as the collections accounts from 2001 were no longer on my credit report......It is important to note that one of my bank card holders raised my credit limit at a time when banks were lowering credit limits and the bank that raised my APR, never lowered my credit limit......I'm not a high risk, I'm a cash cow and enslaved to the BIG Banks!!

"I have never been late on any payments, quicker and quicker I have been getting out of debt. My wife and I both teach and we simply want to refinance and get rid of our remaining credit card debt from college. We have 2 credit cards, this one and one with a $3000 balance. We have a repayment plan but we really don't want to pay 19% on this card. I figure if they are going to jack up my interest to 19% Id rather refinance and give the interest to actual people instead of corporations. Plus Ill get a better fixed rate. Please consider funding our loan and if you have any questions feel free to ask. Thanks!",0,0.3409811
"  Borrower added on 10/29/10 > Hi all,<br/><br/>Thanks to those who have already invested, and I hope to answer the questions posed by a few of you with regards to current debt/expenses.<br/><br/>I currently have no mortgage, auto, or school loans independent of my credit/consumer debts.  I am the sole wage earner and have no children or child care expenses.  I do currently have enough in 401K to NOT take out a loan, but don't want to go the cash-out route for a number of reasons (tax purposes and retirement considerations at the very top of that list).<br/><br/>The credit debt is a mixture of consumer purchases, auto repairs, medical, dental, and veterinary bills, plus (honestly), some fun and vacation expenses.<br/><br/>I am paid an hourly rate at my primary job (employed there for 6 years, this month), and my minimum net income is approximately $3100/month and will max out at approximately $3800/month net, depending on the available overtime.  <br/><br/>Here are my approximate outstanding debts/interest rates/monthly payments (I've been attempting to pay beyond the minimum every month on the higher rates, as I can):<br/><br/>acct1 $14360 /  20.01% / $330<br/>acct2 $11873 / 16.65% /  $330<br/>acct3 $1046 / 16.99% /  $100<br/>acct4 $5846 / 22.99%/  $300<br/>acct5 $3922 / 26.24% / $150<br/><br/>TOTAL consumer debt expenses: approximately $1210/month<br/><br/>This loan would allow me to completely pay off the three highest-interest balances (&gt;20%).  Those are amazingly not penalty rates!  I do have a large sum debt, but I earn a decent wage and never submit a late payment.  This is important to me personally.<br/><br/>This loan would allow me to reduce my overall interest rates by quite a bit, and pay this down at a much more aggressive schedule, while paying slightly (~$25) less per month than I'm doing now.  As I said, I do make enough now to pay my bills on time every month, but I'm not making near enough progress, and am not able to build up decent savings beyond 401K.  <br/><br/>As a side note, I'd like to also mention that I've recently done a few things to help my myself regardless of the outcome of this loan.  I've cut my TV service and gym membership entirely (savings of $190/month) and picked up a second, part-time job this month.   This job will increase my income by approximately $500-$600/month, a positive swing in my favor.<br/><br/>That leaves the following expenses:<br/>-rent, $1075/month<br/>-gas and electric, approx $35/month combined<br/>-cell phone, approx $150/month<br/>-internet, $30/month<br/><br/>TOTAL monthly expenses (consumer debt listed above included): approx $2500/month<br/><br/>There hasn't been a great deal left after groceries, gas/auto, and any entertainment, so as I said, it's been a challenge to save and pay this debt down at a decent rate at all.<br/><br/>I feel like this is a very doable thing for me and could do it on my own regardless, but the opportunity for the loan here would save me quite a bit of money and put me on a much more favorable timetable, and I'm very excited to get started on this and pay these debts.  Again, thanks for those who have invested their help already, and to those who have expressed enough interest to ask for more info.  Sorry for being so wordy, but I wanted to be thorough.  Thanks again.<br/>",0,0.34034935

"Purpose of loan:  This loan will fund the expansion of my side consulting business.  I am a successful software engineer with 10 years experience, 5 in a big corporation, 5 as a consultant.  I have a full time consulting position but I run an additional side consulting business in a different market and therefore do not compete with my employer.  This loan will pay for lead generation and conversion, marketing materials, and escrow for subcontractors.  After many months of research and study I have determined the best ways to scale my side consulting business using less of my time and efforts.  I will expand through referral systems, passive income products such as information products and software components, and outsourcing development to qualified teams in India, Russia, etc.  My financial situation:  Don't be alarmed by my high revolving balances.  It is essentially a wash.  Whenever I receive a 0% introductory rate on a credit line, I take the money and write out-of-the-money uncovered puts at 30% equity in my brokerage account.  When the introductory rate is close to expiration, I pay the credit line back.  Unlike this loan, the good rates typically only last 6 months.  I have strong character and uphold all my obligations.  I have never missed a payment in my life. This includes the 18 month period when I had a parent near death with cancer surgeries, had my first child with my wife after being cheated out of health insurance ($50,000 loss there even though we're all perfectly healthy and had a perfect delivery), moved from one state to another, and sold two houses (I owned a rental property).

"Thank you for considering investing your money in my loan.  While the numbers crunch out to a D2 loan, let me take you beyond the numbers and show you how this is not your typical D2 loan.  The funds from this loan will be used strictly to pay down debts which carry significantly higher interest rates.  I experienced some life events in the past that caused the current situation.  I have worked hard to improve credit score and pay down the debts but with the interest rates so high its a real struggle.  I have been employed for 15 years with the same company (Fortune 50) so I have a stable work history.  As a result of my steady work history, I do not miss a payment which is one of the reasons why I qualify for this loan.  My current budget for debt repayment is $1,300 and this loan will reduce that to about $800 which will free up much needed cash to pay down the remainder of my debt faster and ensure that I provide you the return on your investment as agreed.  I am a good borrower because I have a steady history of paying my bills on time, very stable work history, clearly can afford the payments and I much rather pay you the not-so-great interest of 17% than to pay a greedy, unscrupulous giant credit card company.  You make money, I save money and credit card companies lose money. win-win!""",0,0.34040806

"My wife had the privilege to attend graduate school in Chicago at Roosevelt University for the past two summers.  It is a great honor for her and for the state of Mississippi since she is the first Mississippi theatre teacher at attend.  She is scheduled to attend her third and final summer this June.  There is a snag.  Due to a horrible mix up with her old collegiate student loans her financial aid for Summer 2008 was rescinded and she must pay right at $6000.00 in tuition before she can be registered this summer.  The original payment deadline is mid April, but Roosevelt has extended the deadline for us until early June. If she does not attend this summer, the courses she needs will not be offered again until summer 2012.   The final part of the program is a thesis production scheduled for spring 2010.  If she cannot attend this summer that production will be moved back until spring 2013.  All of the students who have begun preparation for the 2010 production will have graduated and will have lost their opportuniy to shine in this historic production.  The production is scheduled to be ""The Miracle Worker"" which chronicles the life of Helen Keller and will be an outreach to the hearing impaired community in our metropolitan area.

"  Borrower added on 08/11/10 > Since Congress subjected credit card companies with more restrictions, they in turn went after the card holders. I had two credit cards with high credit line amounts cut down to just above the current amount owed (such as $21,000 to 10,900 and it drops every time I pay another 500 off). This ratio of total credit line to amount owed was always an emergency buffer in case of unforeseen expenses. This also affected my credit rating (was 730 a year ago) by lowering the owed to available ratio). I have a few expenses such as car repairs and a small garage roof leak which I'm putting off due to not enough credit card balance. I also have a few doctor bills (after the insurance paid their portion) for when my wife had a hospital visit due to a heart issue. I would use the money to pay these several small amounts and also pay off a few small amounts on store/gas/Dell credit accounts. The remainder would be kept in the bank as reserve so I wouldn't need to use a credit card and I can concentrate on paying them down to improve my credit rating.

"  Borrower added on 06/26/10 > For the past four years, I have enjoyed increasing success as a gaffer.  This means I, in conjunction with a Director of Photography (DP) determine the necessary equipment and design for lighting movies, commercials, and music videos.  Most often, I focus on commercials, both industrial (private), and advertising (public).<br/><br/>In order to perform my job, after I make an assessment of the work and equipment needed, and compile a detailed list for the production company so they may rent the lighting gear through a rental company.  <br/><br/>Over the past year, I have come to the point where I often work with the same DPs, using the same lighting set ups.  However, I still have to rent the gear.  My intent in asking for the loan is to allow me, in combination with money I've saved, to buy a small but comprehensive lighting package that will allow me to collect the rental fees from the production company into my own pocket, instead of watching the money go to some one else.  In addition to allowing me to be paid for the rentals, the lighting package will allow me to start accepting jobs I've had to turn down for lack of owning my own gear.<br/><br/>I can provide a detailed list of the equipment I intend to purchase if so desired.  In combination with some gear I already own, the rental fee I would be able to charge for my rental package would amount to $500 - $700 per day in addtition to my day rate.  The rental alone would pay for the loan after approximately 14 to 20 rental days. <br/>Each year of my career has led to more money than the last, and as of this year I have been earning an average of $4500 / month.  Although theoretically I could probably afford to borrow more than the $10k I'm asking for, I prefer this amount because in the unlikely event I were never able to rent my gear, I could still afford to both pay back the loan and continue to put money into a savings account.<br/>",0,0.34046

"I am looking to simplify my debt structure and reduce total cash out each month. I am looking to consolidate my 4 revolving accounts and pay off negative equity on my car to accomplish this.   I also just had a major wind storm come through my area, which damaged portions of my fence. After discussing options with my neighbor, we decided to co-operate and replace the whole thing, as it was pretty old and an insurance claim is not likely to help in this case. Instead of adding it to my credit card debt, I would like to add it into this loan. This portion is to help pay for my portion of the fence project which is an estimated total project budget of $2500.  My current credit card debt structure is as follows:  Credit Card 1: $3545 / $4500 (Credit Limit) Credit Card 2: $2927 / $5000 (Credit Limit) Credit Card 3: $857   / $1500 (Credit Limit) Credit Card 4: $597   / $3600 (Credit Limit) Total Card Balances: $7626 / $14,600 (Total Credit Limit) Total Current Payments out: $553.00 ($134 minimum payments) Consolidated Payments with this loan: $481.79   Car Balance: $13891 Car Value (Kelly Blue Book): $8,300 Total Negative Equity: $5,591 Total Current Car Payment: $365.65/month Total Car Payment after Re-Finance: $164.35 (Assuming Current 7.2% Rate)  Current Combined Payments: $918.65/month New Combined Payments: $646.14/month Total Savings: $272.21/month  I have been paying all available cash at the end of each month trying to pay this down for awhile now. This has amounted to over $900 a month in combined payments. I plan on continuing to make these payments so this loan as long as I can so it will likely be paid of early.

"As the cost of credit has gotten more expensive, a couple of my credit cards, on which I maintain significant balances, have increased the interest rates as their cost of borrowing has risen. American express, for example, was at 6.99% last year, and has made 2 universal increases and now stands at 15.99%, even though my credit situation has not changed and I have never been late on any payments to any lender. This is a practice which it seems is becoming more common. For example, on Amex -  http://www.credit.com/forum/posts/list/339.page#1121 http://www.creditaddict.com/archives/american-express-amex-change-in-cardmember-terms-apr-rate-increases/ http://www.complaintsboard.com/complaints/american-express-c142633.html  I wish to avoid the random increases and consolidate at a lower rate. Also, the 3 year term and consolidated payment make it easier for me to manage.  I have a revolving line of credit from Bank of America which has available monies to consolidate, but again at a higher rate. I want to try this site, as it appears to be more cost effective.   I am a reliable person, as I've had no late payments on any account anywhere in my credit history. I take my credit rating very seriously and am scrupulous in my management and payment of my debts. For this reason, I am a good credit risk. My credit is perfect, although I do have a relatively high debt load as a result of student loans that I used to obtain my MBA. ",0,0.34032965

" I am a high school teacher seeking a loan to purchase a reliable, but modestly priced car. In the past year and a half, my husband and I have paid off over $15,000 of credit card and auto debt that we slowly accrued while I was a stay-at-home mom. We were looking forward to paying the rest off by springtime, but both of our well-worn cars (over 230K miles each!) have bitten the dust within two weeks of each other. Except for a small emergency fund, all of our extra income has gone toward debt repayment, so we don’t have enough cash on hand to replace both cars at once. Standard auto loans require that the cars be 2003 or newer, and that we spend at least $7,500 on each—but that’s way more than we need or want to borrow! My credit score is excellent, so the interest rate they’ve offered is good, but I’m hoping to demonstrate for my kids some good old fashioned fiscal responsibility—by minimizing debt and working toward a more secure financial future. We’ve researched our local market, and have found that a $5000 loan-- combined with the cash we have-- will purchase two older but highly reliable cars that, if not too pretty, will get us through our daily work and school commutes safely and reliably.   Thank you for your generous consideration! D. Loving ",0,0.34043387

I was not able to move into this house until December 2010 but by this time the house payments were already 11 months behind.

"I am requesting this loan to consolidate debt which I am currently carrying on credit cards whose interest rates vary from 14% to 23%.  I have accumulated this debt over the past eight years, beginning with my college days and continuing into the early days of building my career.  I have been with the same company for four years now.  They own and operate eight (soon to be nine) art galleries in two states. I began working for one of their galleries as a contract photographer.  Within the first six months, I was also building their website and designing their print ads. Shortly thereafter I began doing similar work for some of their other galleries, which were located out of state. After a year as a contract employee, they offered me a full time position doing photography and web/print design for all eight of their galleries.  I am now a salaried employee, whose main focus is growing within the company and paying off my debts.  I am single, with no dependents, and believe I live a frugal life.  I rent an apartment, drive a car that has been paid off for three years and believe that until I am debt free, I have no discretionary income.  Working in the computer field and participating in the rise of social networking, I am excited to see peer-to-peer lending taking off.  I see it as a wonderful solution for both investors and borrowers, and hope to be on the other side of the table one day soon.  I believe Lending Club and their investors can help to make a huge difference in my life.  I sincerely appreciate your consideration.",0,0.34067017

Due to a business start up 5 years ago I am currently paying off some high interest credit card debt. This debt was the result of the first couple years of working for free  in order to grow the business.   At the current time our business is doing great however we are in the situation where we need to continue to put money into the brand. This simply put means we still work for a rather small paycheck.  In my current situation I pay much more then my monthly minimum payments to pay down my debt. This is a great help but due to the fact that I have a few high interest cards it will still take years to finish the payments.  At the moment I make two payments. It would be a dream come true to combine these into one payment each month. Thanks and sweet dreams.,0,0.34077802
