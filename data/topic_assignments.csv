"  Borrower added on 06/22/11 > Our business is expanding, and at the moment we do not have the space to support the increase in demand for more inventory. The funds will be an extension to the bridge of capital on-hand to assist in expanding our business and making necessary purchases and upgrades that will not only improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our internal operations, but also greatly enhance the customers' overall shopping experience. We will use the funds for the following: A cash register with robust storage and automation capabilities; more shelving for the larger storage room; a larger company sign, advertisement in adjacent communities, small customer and employee incentives, inventory scanners, aesthetic details and upgrades that appeal to the senses of our customers, a larger retail space. What makes me a good borrower is my history with the Lending Club as well as my credit score. We obtained some funding when we opened the doors to our company last year. In just a short amount of time we were able to pay that loan off in full. I am in the U.S. Army so my income is more than stable. I earn a comfortable salary, and I have a little more than 10 years until I retire. My business partner and I are not fans of debt. We barely have any. I have a cell phone bill, and car insurance payments. I receive a housing stipend so my rent, food, and utilities are paid by the military. My best friend and business partner has a cell phone bill, drives a scooter (paid for with cash and has a $20 per month insurance bill), and is pursuing his MBA. He is totally immersed in the world of business and believes in providing for the business first. So other than books for school and maybe an occassional quick bite from a restaurant his debt is minimal as well. We whole-heartedly believe in living well below our means. Our life is our company, and we enjoy the sweat we put into it while watching it grow. We see no need in going through banks to apply for business loans with minimums of $50,000-$150,000. Those amounts do not match the steady and calculated pace of our business. After Lending Club was featured on CNBC earlier this year, my partner and I knew we were in the among great company, and chose to come back to where we started for capital supplementation.<br/>",-1

"Good afternoon,  I would like a loan of $20,000 to consolidate my debt including my car loan.  I would very much rather owe one institution/lender than several.  This way I could also save on my car insurance, by not having to have full-coverage.    Also, I do get paid cash but this has not affected my credit score since I have paid on time, not going to say always because there were two instances where I paid late, but not later than 15 days past the due date, and this was over a year.    I'm responsible and in no manner will I misuse the money.  I'm a college graduate, hence why I'm in debt, I used my credit cards for tuition, books, gas, meals, and supplies.  I don't want to damage my credit, so debt consolidation is out of the question, so is bankruptcy.  I don't believe in the easy way out, regardless the situation I made a conscious choice to use my credit cards even though it was for college.  But now, I ask to have only one payment, it would facilitate making the payments, less of a headache.  Please consider my request, I will be forever grateful.  ",1

"Purpose of loan: This loan will be used to purchase a new outboard motor for my biggest rental boat, a 26' center console.  This boat is the one that gives the company the best return, and we can't afford to have it down.  The motor pictured blew up following a salvage of it when a customer ran the motor into a dock and knocked the motor off of the boat.  The motor was under water for about an hour, and though we were able to get it running again, it wasn't completely saved. It appears something got tweaked inside when it got wet while running. This is a large center console fishing boat that is in demand on a daily basis.  My financial situation: I am a good candidate for this loan because I plan to use the money to continue to grow my small business.  I have always been financially responsible, and have never been late in paying anything.  I purchased this business last year, investing a good portion of my life savings as well as some home equity into it.  I have grown the revenue roughly 40% over the previous ownership, and I have become a one-stop-shop for everything fun related in conjunction with watersports.  In 10 months we have added 2 more boats and 2 waverunners, 4 kayaks, 3 surfboards, a banana boat, boogie boards, as well as other revenue generating equipment to the fleet.  I have developed working relationships with Hilton, Marriott, and various other resort companies here in South Florida, and I plan to begin an online reservation system and Franchise plan in the near future.  This extra capital will allow me to stretch a vital purchase out over time in order to not hinder further growth and progress of my small business. ",24

"First let me say I am very fortunate, I have a great job that pays me well with great benefits, including health insurance. Unfortunately, my son was very ill  from February through May and was hospitalized 3 times not including 5 or 6 ER Visits, an ambulance ride and numerous laboratory visits for bloodwork...oh and let's not forget the unbelievably expensive prescriptions.  I have been plugging through the bills as they continue to roll in and now just when I thought I could get all of the ""co-pays"" caught up..along comes another illness that has already included a 2 day hospitalization,  and another one coming up, he is scheduled for surgery on August 28th.  Of course trying to balance all of the medical bills, other things have suffered.  My vehicle is in need of some work..simple maintenance things like brakes and tires but these of course have taken back seat to my son's health care needs.

"Dear Lending Club Lenders:  I am a current Prosper borrower with an excellent credit profile and with an excellent re-payment history. I have 3 payments left on my current 3 year Prosper loan which I have never been late in making payments on.  Also, this is evidenced by my credit history, of which I only have 4 tradelines including the Prosper loan.    I am a first time homeowner having just purchased my home at the end of last year.  I purchased my house as-is knowing I would need to replace all the flooring which is worn-out and damaged.  I have received several estimates and they are all in the $6800-8000 range.  This investment would improve my home greatly, in both liveability and value.  I am well within the DTI guidelines including my mortgage and will have no problems repaying the loan off on time, as evidenced by my last/current loan.  I have been empployed in the same profession for over 25 years, have minimal debt, and the same car for the last 7 years which is paid off.  I enjoy spending my free time at home and being able to replace the flooring would make my home more livable and enjoyable.  ",-1

"  Borrower added on 06/29/10 > Dear Lenders:<br/>As I turned the corner into my 30s, I started realizing that my lifestyle was not indicative of my income.  Granted, living in Manhattan can have this impact on many professionals, however, I found my particular financial constraints to be beyond requiring a closely monitored budget.  <br/><br/>In analyzing my finances,  I realized how severely imbalanced much budget was due to carrying an enormous amount of credit card debt.  <br/><br/>This is an old debt, this is a debt due to times of unemployment during the dotcom bubble 10 years ago, this is a debt due to medical issue in my late 20s and it is a debt that has weighed heavily on me.  I thought if I worked hard enough on it, it would eventually get paid off. <br/><br/>In the past two years, I have not been able to make any headway at all.  From trying to get APRs reduced, to trying to consolidate credit, to stacking credit card payments, I've reached a deadlock in many directions.  <br/><br/>Three key factors make me an excellent candidate for a loan.  <br/>-The first is that I have a healthy income which can support loan payments.  <br/>-The second is that I'm making changes in my personal life that will help me to pay off my loan at a faster rate than anticipated.  In 6 weeks, I'll be moving out of Manhattan into a less expensive apartment and a less expensive neighborhood in Queens, NY.  I'm selling my car so that I can eliminate my car insurance and using the sale money to help pay off my debts, I've switched gyms to reduce membership fees, and am canceling cable to help cut down on monthly bills.<br/>-The third is that I am a well educated borrower with a support network that can help me make sound financial decisions for my future.<br/><br/>I thank you for you consideration.<br/>",1

A way from the darkness that distracted me from keeping my responsibility's and insuring my savings.  Today I am free of my alimony and child support payments, and at least retain my income and career.  But if I do not find a way to get my living space repaired, it will cost me 10 times as much in just a couple months.

This will be a fun project for me as well as a good investment.

We simply build a relationship based on mutual interests and a desire to help where we can. It is only after this initial phase that we offer to do the work that piqued their interest the most.<br/> Borrower added on 11/09/11 > Another important part if our business is working with local businesses to integrate social media into their marketing. B2B companies must utilize LinkedIn, for instance. Facebook is more appropriate for business to customer relationships. In addition, there is YouTube, Twitter, and GooglePlus. We help define up the best strategy for the particular company. We then set up the necessary accounts and teach our clients how to use their social media accounts. Alternately, we will manage these accounts on behalf of the company. Participating in Social Media can be time-consuming, but it is also crucial. Thus, we offer to manage a company's social media profiles. <br>",8

Even though I had medical insurance my medical bills still totaled over $10k.  I plan to use the majority of these funds ($6600) to pay off this debt which is currently at 21.9%.  The remaining funds I intend to pay off my credit card debt which is approximately $1600 at 29.4%.  I believe by combining these two debts into one it will allow me to pay them off quicker, and by doing that it would help me put this accident behind me and move on.<br/><br/>What makes you a good borrower?<br/><br/>I am a very responsible person.  Other than the two debts above I have a car loan of $19600 at 4.25% (because I had to replace my wrecked car), and I have an outstanding student loan in repayment from college.  I believe in paying cash for as much as possible and am not one to overindulge in things I canât afford.<br/><br/>How stable is your job?<br/><br/>I have a very stable job with a large company that has been around for over 50 years.  I am the Event and Tradeshow Manager here in the Silicon Valley, and currently manage 35+ events and tradeshows a year.

"I bought a house about 8 months ago and renovated the entire house. Even though I had savings to pay for the renovations, I ended up spending more than I anticipated. I ended up using my credit cards and financing some of my big purchases. I am not very concerned about my credit card, because I am negotiating with the credit card companies to lower the interest rates. What I would like to do is pay off the cards that has promotional period ending soon(approx $5,000) to avoid paying accrued interest. My total debt is about $20,000 and $5,000 of this amount need to be paid very soon. I will spend the remaining loan to pay the high interest credit cards. I've been working for a state university for 3 years. I make $2,600 a month after tax.  I have always paid full amount on my credit cards until this big home renovation project. Now that the house is completely done, I am back to a more conservative spending pattern. I will definitely pay the loan back as scheduled.

"First, thank you for your consideration. I've been a Chicago resident for approximately 3 years. I came here from NYC with virtually nothing but my clothes and with help and some luck, have built a stable life working and living in the Downtown area. I'm currently working as the Business Development Director for an IT consulting firm. I started at the associate level and was promoted twice In my 2 years working at the company. My gross annual income including base + comm. is between 40--48K based on current performance, estimated to increase. My primary fixed monthly expenses are rent including utilities ($850), Groceries and food ($350) and debt financing ($300). I'm not an extravagant spender and virtually all my debt is the result of having to finance the various aspects of middle class living (computer, furniture, etc) and a medical expense before I could build up significant savings after moving to Chicago. I'm applying for a loan primarily to refinance my main credit card debt, which is currently carrying a balance of about $3,500. I used it for large home/furniture purchases and one-time medical expenses over the past 1 1/2 years. After the 12 month promotional period expired, the APR on the card went up first to 19% and then to 23%. Coupled with escalating fees, I'm throwing money down the toilet and hardly touching my principle. The initial pay-down plan I devised to avoid interest charges was foiled by aforementioned medical cost, which was unforeseen. I have a couple other low-limit store-brand cards used for a computer purchase and television that I would also like to pay down as well. The interest is less of an issue here but it would be helpful to consolidate all my debt with one loan payment at a lower APR, over a longer period of time. Anything left over after I consolidate my debt will be put toward the purchase of a new bike--in order to save money on commuting!! Thank You.""",1

"Thank you for your consideration in funding my loan.   Prior to the recession, I was a Sales position for Training and Development.

"  Borrower added on 12/07/10 > Fellow LC Lender needs Loan #2<br/><br/>Hello Fellow LC Lenders:<br/><br/>As with our 1st LC loan, we are respectfully asking your help to fund us for a 2nd loan for home improvement/debt consolidation purposes.  We have put onto a rewards credit card the following items:  New roof ($11000), 60 ft. tree removal ($3500), Living Will and Trust ($1000), new garage door ($1000), new shed ($500).  Our 1st loan was for a central hvac system install we had done this summer.  If you would like to see for yourself our payment status, the loan # is 516563.  As before, we have outlined our budget information for you as well as other pertinent information that will hopefully give you confidence in funding us.  <br/><br/>Our typical monthly expenses include (approximately):<br/>* mortgage - $1575<br/>* power - around $200<br/>* cell phones - $100<br/>* credit cards (paid off each month) - varies<br/>* student loans - $380<br/>* food - $600<br/>* no car payments<br/>* we rarely go out, so no real entertainment<br/><br/>The income stated for this loan is mine alone, but my wife has been putting in more hours at her work than before so the additional income from that is about $1600-$1900 / month as a part time staff accountant. Both of our jobs are stable, and we are very strict with our budget.  This loan will be used to move the items mentioned above (roof, tree removal, Will &amp; Trust, garage door &amp; shed) to a much better interest rate than our 11% credit card, preferably before the cycle turns over so we can pay off the card in full as usual.  As for our other asset-related accounts (because someone else asked us about it last time), we have the following:<br/><br/>401k - $34,500.00<br/>Lending Club (investor) - $7,375.00<br/>Savings - $3,200.00<br/><br/>Thanks for looking at our application and please feel free to ask us any further questions.  We will be more than happy to answer them promptly.  Thanks much!<br/>",-1

"  Borrower added on 07/12/10 > Hello. I currently work a 40 hour a week union job as well as a part time / on call position as a receptionist. I am slated to have a review and raise in about six months for my full time job. I am not behind on my bills or in an enormous amount of debt but I'd like to consolidate my bills down to as few payments as possible. I was originally going to go for a 36 month loan but decided on the 60 month due to the smaller payment. This way I can pay the amount I would for the 36 month loan and get ahead a little bit. I am a responsible borrower, as my credit score reflects. When I separated from the military four years ago I didn't really have any credit since I was overseas and didn't have any credit cards, since then I have worked very hard to establish and maintain good credit. <br/><br/>With this loan I plan to consolidate my current debt down to one bill a month and ideally get a decent used car. The car I have at the moment is not particularly reliable, especially with winter coming. Thank you for taking the time to review my loan request. :)<br/>",1

Since October I have had 3 stents put in my left artery to open up all the blockages that I had.  If I were to get the loan I would use the money to help me pay for a gastric sleeve surgery, this is a type of weight loss surgery. Studies show that overweight diabetic type 2 patients benefit from this surgery by putting the diabetes in remission or completly eliminating it.   I want the surgery because it would help with my diabetes and my weight. I would like to be able to live a life where I do not have to worry about getting more heart attacks or worry about my sugar all the time. I have been diabetis for 11 years.  I would like to be able to travel but I cannot since I have to have my cardiologist near by since I suffer from silent heart attacks. In the past 5 months I have been in the hospital 4 times. This surgery would greatly reduce the visits to the hospitals.  If I got the loan I would repay it on time. My salary at the moment is $48k a year and in July I will start at new job where I will be earning $55k a year.  I have saved up for most of the surgery which costs $20K I am only missing $5500. ",-1

"I am a very responsible person and am asking for a loan so that I can pay off my credit cards without using a debt reduction company.   I am a teacher in California and I was caught somewhat unprepared financially when my hours were significantly reduced during the summer.  I called my credit card companies to see if they would work with me about not making my normal payment, I have always made all of my payments on time and always more than the minimum payment.  I have had most of my credit cards for over 15-20 years and have always paid on time.  Each company I spoke with was not willing to help me at all.  I have worked during the summer for a private educational company. I have taken the opprotunity of working less hours to learn to teach 2 new classes and will be teaching them beginning in October.  I also learned to be a notary and a loan document signing notary and will use these new skills to help pay off the loan.  I would prefer to pay off the debt rather then go the route of a reduction program but am angry that the credit companies refused to consider my request.  I'd rather see someone else get the interest.  My hours return to normal on August 31. I am a good bet, I work hard and will pay off everything borrowed.",1

The items on debt were purchased to supplement my income as a professional audio technician and I just want to make 1 easy payment per month instead of 3 different payments.  I am also a partial owner of a duplex so I get supplemental income off of that as well.<br/> Borrower added on 12/03/10 > And to add to this description, I have worked at the same job, for a local energy company doing corporate audio for training and business conferences for the past 2 years going on my third.  I have worked in this industry for over 6 years now and have firmly established myself in both my industry and my company...<br/><br/>I get a paycheck weekly, not monthly or bi-weekly, and generally have a surpluss of $300 a week after all bills and basic stuff like food, water, and gas.  By consildating my credit card bills I hope to make a single payment once a month to pay off my bills so that I may save at a higher rate and build a large savings account.  My entire purpose for this loan is to consolidate my credit into 1 monthly payment and close all other forms of credit down.  The idea is that I will be paying less on interest since it is 1 account instead of 3, but you as the investor will be getting your share of the interest.  I even enjoy getting this loan in this manner as opposed to a bank or a credit card, as I would much rather my interest payments go to other regular folks and not giant banks or credit card companies.<br/><br/>Thank you for investing in me! I am just turning 30, have a firmly established job and place to stay and am now trying to save, grow financially, and put together a nice nest egg for myself through my hardwork and dedication to my craft.<br/>",1

"  Borrower added on 01/13/10 > A little about myself: I work as a senior architect/developer for a health-care financial services company, I've been employed for just over four years now.<br/><br/>Reason I require the loan: I require the loan in order to pay the payroll taxes for a company (not the one I work for) I had started last year. The company has since been dissolved, but our primary investor cut-and ran with our employee payroll taxes. I cannot afford to wait for the courts to resolve the situation as end of quarter filings are due soon.<br/><br/>How I plan on paying back the loan: The loan will be paid back using my personal funds derived from my employment. A personal was the best option in my case as the other assets that I have either aren't liquid or the taxes/penalties I would incur on them are more than the cost of the loan in this case (ie: a 401k hardship withdrawal or a non-eligible expense from an HSA account.)<br/>",20

"Purpose of loan: This loan will be used as capital towards the purchase of an Edible Arrangements franchise.  I have already done all the research on the franchise and it offers an excellent product and terrific franchisee support.  Their growth has been exponential over the last four (4) years.  To date, none of the franchises have ceased operations.  Edible Arrangements has availability to develop a store in Washington, DC or McLean, VA.  I am in line for either of the stores, if I can provide proof of $50,000 capital.  I have $30,000 of my own funds and need another $20,000 so I can move forward.  My financial situation: I am a good candidate for this loan because I am committed to (paying) my obligations.  I have always held steady employment.     I do not have experience in this particular industry, which is why I chose to move forward with a franchise for that added expertise and support.  I have eight years of HR experience, and my daughter, which will manage the day-to-day operations of the Edible Arrangements store, has HR experience and a degree in Business Administration. I will keep my full-time day job. That way I can keep a steady flow of income coming in.  ",1

"I want to get this loan to keep build my credit rating by having an installment loan for the next three years. I took out a loan for $15000 in 2007 for flight school. Currently I owe about $7000 on that loan. My brother was a cosigner on that loan so I want to get rid of that ASAP which will get my brothers credit out of limbo. I have a boat a truck and a Honda civic all paid for. I just sold the boat for $3200 on Ebay and I will be selling my truck that I used to tow the boat since I have no need for that. I should get around $4000 for that since it is a 1999 Chevy Silverado. I just did my taxes and my refund is $2600. With this money I will pay off the rest of my flight school loan and start a savings fund for a down payment on a house. I make $13 an hour as a maintenance supervisor and I go to school full time. I was in the Army and I am currently in the National Guard. The guard pays 100% tuition and my GI Bill pays me $1300 a month to go to school. I have 3 credit cards two are around $300 and one is at $1000. I live with my girlfriend and we split the rent and cell phone bill. My bills for the month are around $800.   With the money I will buy a motorcycle for under $10,000 and keep 1-2000 as another emergency fund. I already have $1000 set aside for emergencies. I figured it would be best to buy a motorcycle since insurance is cheap.  My credit rating has been in the low 700's and I want it as close to 800 as possible. I rather keep an installment loan to reach that score so I can save money on a mortgage some day.  I know investing in other people is a risk but I have paid off every loan early and never missed a payment on any of them. There will always be money available for a payment from my checking account.

"  Borrower added on 06/27/11 > This loan is to consolidate two high-interest credit cards into a more manageable monthly payment, as well as a more sensible interest rate adjustment.  The balance on one card is $4800 with 22% interest and $4700 with 20.5% interest.  I'm not sure how the interest rates crept up that high, as I have never been late with a payment, but I suppose that's how they get you.  I obtained both cards back in college and both had a $500 limit.  I paid the balance off in full each month and I was rewarded with credit limit increases until both were at $5k each (now much to my dismay). <br/><br/>I bought a home in April 2009.  The home was a foreclosure and I ended up using the credit cards to make it livable on the hopes of a promotion that I was in line for at work.  That promotion never came to fruition and I was stuck with the high balances.  Fast forward a year and I now have stable employment with the federal government, along with a higher salary, and I want to rid myself of these credit cards now.  One is already cut up, the other is for emergencies only.  I plan on using this loan to pay the balances of both off in full.  Whatever funds remain (~$1000) will be placed into a rainy day emergency fund. Thank you for your time and hopefully your investment.<br/>",1

Due to a business start up 5 years ago I am currently paying off some high interest credit card debt. This debt was the result of the first couple years of working for free  in order to grow the business.   At the current time our business is doing great however we are in the situation where we need to continue to put money into the brand. This simply put means we still work for a rather small paycheck.  In my current situation I pay much more then my monthly minimum payments to pay down my debt. This is a great help but due to the fact that I have a few high interest cards it will still take years to finish the payments.  At the moment I make two payments. It would be a dream come true to combine these into one payment each month. Thanks and sweet dreams.,-1

"As the cost of credit has gotten more expensive, a couple of my credit cards, on which I maintain significant balances, have increased the interest rates as their cost of borrowing has risen. American express, for example, was at 6.99% last year, and has made 2 universal increases and now stands at 15.99%, even though my credit situation has not changed and I have never been late on any payments to any lender. This is a practice which it seems is becoming more common. For example, on Amex -  http://www.credit.com/forum/posts/list/339.page#1121 http://www.creditaddict.com/archives/american-express-amex-change-in-cardmember-terms-apr-rate-increases/ http://www.complaintsboard.com/complaints/american-express-c142633.html  I wish to avoid the random increases and consolidate at a lower rate. Also, the 3 year term and consolidated payment make it easier for me to manage.  I have a revolving line of credit from Bank of America which has available monies to consolidate, but again at a higher rate. I want to try this site, as it appears to be more cost effective.   I am a reliable person, as I've had no late payments on any account anywhere in my credit history. I take my credit rating very seriously and am scrupulous in my management and payment of my debts. For this reason, I am a good credit risk. My credit is perfect, although I do have a relatively high debt load as a result of student loans that I used to obtain my MBA. ",-1

"The purpose of the loan is to pay off current high interest credit cards and pay off my debt.  For the first time in my life, I was unemployed in 2001 (last recession) for 8 months and used credit cards to pay expenses.  I chose not to file bankruptcy as I felt responsible to pay my debts. A few collection accounts (paid) from 2001 adversely affected my credit score for the past 7 years which meant the credit card APR's were high and paying down the debt was difficult.  Despite making more than the minimum payments;  making steady payments; and having a stable job (professional) and residency, my credit card/loan accounts are with the now notable BIG three banks.  In January of 2008, one of the banks raised my APR without providing a reason in writing!  I received a letter, but it only stated my APR would increase.  First I was told it was because of an adverse credit report and when I checked into this, it was not accurate.  Over the course of a year, when I requested to have the rate returned to the previous APR or reduced, the request was refused.  BUT, they were more than willing to offer me a ""great deal"" where they would give me another credit card at a low interest rate!!  I refused and when I did the research, I discovered that this was a new tactic being used where the higher interest credit card account would have been closed and opening another account would have adversely affected my credit score (thus further indebting me to that bank)!!!!  This offer occurred when my credit score improved as the collections accounts from 2001 were no longer on my credit report......It is important to note that one of my bank card holders raised my credit limit at a time when banks were lowering credit limits and the bank that raised my APR, never lowered my credit limit......I'm not a high risk, I'm a cash cow and enslaved to the BIG Banks!!  Help!!!! ",0

"The most credit card debt that I have incurred was last year when a serious medical issue struck me (actualy my young son who was 2 back then. Since I had a medical insurance with a high deductible I had some medical bills around $ 4000 to pay in short time and I resorted to credit cards, at that time I did not have more than 4000 debt, so that is how I pilled up on my credit card debts, and ever since I can not recover due to high interest rates and finance charges to a couple of them, Merrick 27.70%, with around $1900 owed, Chase  19.74% $2181 owed, Bank Of America 13.74% and $4113 , Sears 22.58% with $ 2000 owed.I had a few credit cards because I was at the begining of  building my credit history. I am still paying my bills on time but it is very hard to keep up due to finance charges and interests added up.I would like to pay all of these debts at one time and then cancel out Merrick, Chase and Sears, and only keep one credit card, meantime pay only one loan,one interest.  As for my medical insurance  I have a very good one now with my employer.  On the other hand I would like to buy a house, but before that I would like to wipe out most of these debts in a reasonable time and manner, I want to be only commited to the mortgage alone. I have a good job I am a foreman Electrician and make decent money but since I was the only income for my wife and 2 kids, last year I had some Work  visas Expenses on te top of the medical Bills. Now my wife she works part time and I am intending to take a second job just so we wipe out any considerable debt before we buy a house.",0

"I've been working on paying down my credit card debt since last summer and have made some headway already. However, I would like to try and consolidate the debt so I can get a better interest rate than the average of 20.99% my cards are charging me. All money would go 100% towards my credit card debt. I have never missed a payment with my cards and am paying it down, but feel the fiscally responsible thing to do would be to try and get a better interest rate and stop having to worry about 4 separate payments every month.

"  Borrower added on 01/28/10 > I've accumulated a bit of CC debt from college, moving to FL, and other miscellaneous expenses.  The bulk of my CC debt is well under control (interest rates at 7-9%) but I do have one card with just under $6k at 19.95%.  In the interest of full disclosure, my vast majority of my CC debt came from college when my father (who was funding my education) basically had his company go under.  Student loans are great, but I have very good credit so I was able to constantly rotate my expenses accrued at school across CCs with 0% balance transfers.  Even today, the bulk of my CC debt has a lower interest rate than my student loans.  Unfortunately, with this recent economic crisis all of my credit lines were slashed so my ratio of revolving credit to available credit went from 1:3, to 1:1 basically overnight.  This obviously had a negative impact on my credit score.  <br/>At the bottom line, I walked away from school with a $100k education and $50k in student loans/CC debt.  Even though the CC debt has a lower interest rate than the student loans, banks can't look away from the stigmata that $25k in CC debt carries.<br/>I have a stable job (recently promoted to Marketing Director, employed here for 3 years now), I'm responsible and, as my debt will attest, I am educated.  I don't pay late, I don't miss payments and I hate that Citi bank refuses to negotiate my 19% interest rate.  I'd much rather help some good people make a little interest.  <br/>Thanks for your consideration -<br/>",-1

"  Borrower added on 01/21/11 > Please help me save my mother's house.  I helped my mother refi her house in 2007 while my oldest brother was living with her and helping her out.  In April 2009 he got extremely sick and we almost lost him.  While he was still under medical care they found colon cancer and after surgery he had a major stroke.  We lost him on 9-7-09.  During this time my mother was trying her best to continue to pay her bills but she was on a fixed civil service retirement and it was a struggle.  We helped out as much as we could but then my husband lost his job after 10 years.  She had started a loan modification which was still in process. In April 2010, she was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer and it was terminal.  She had a mastectomy in 2008 but apparently it came back. We lost her on 8-3-10.  During this time we were living in a rental house and was making rent payments.  I was not able to move into this house until December 2010 but by this time the house payments were already 11 months behind.  My husband is now back to work and we are able to make the regular house payments but not the back payments.  We are looking for assistance is this area.  My mother raised 3 children as a single mother in this house since 1967 and we would be devastated to lose it so please help us.  I have been employed with the County of San Diego for almost 30 years and still have at least another 6 years before retirement so making these payments for 60 months will not be an issue.

As a government employee, I have a stable position.  Since I've been employed with the department (for five years), my income has increased $30,000 annually.

"Thank you for considering investing your money in my loan.  While the numbers crunch out to a D2 loan, let me take you beyond the numbers and show you how this is not your typical D2 loan.  The funds from this loan will be used strictly to pay down debts which carry significantly higher interest rates.  I experienced some life events in the past that caused the current situation.  I have worked hard to improve credit score and pay down the debts but with the interest rates so high its a real struggle.  I have been employed for 15 years with the same company (Fortune 50) so I have a stable work history.  As a result of my steady work history, I do not miss a payment which is one of the reasons why I qualify for this loan.  My current budget for debt repayment is $1,300 and this loan will reduce that to about $800 which will free up much needed cash to pay down the remainder of my debt faster and ensure that I provide you the return on your investment as agreed.  I am a good borrower because I have a steady history of paying my bills on time, very stable work history, clearly can afford the payments and I much rather pay you the not-so-great interest of 17% than to pay a greedy, unscrupulous giant credit card company.  You make money, I save money and credit card companies lose money. win-win!""",1

"Hello,  At the age of 40, and after many years of building up my credit, I found the way to be responsible.

I currently have an ""A"" average (I can provide my transcript), and I work full -time as a Senior Financial Analyst at a fortune 100 company.

Hello. I'm looking at the foreclosure homes for a permanent home. I have found a few that I really like. They just need a little TLC and they won't sit rotting away making the neighborhood look bad. I have two children and we're tired of renting. We want a backyard. Buying a foreclosure home gives us that opportuny to have a decent size house in a good neighborhood. It will give me the chance to invest rather than throwing the money out by renting. I am looking to spend no more than what I spend in rent a month as far as mortgage goes. I am finding out there are a lot of places in my budget and now is the perfect time to buy. Thank you for taking time out for me. We appreciate it.,-1

"I am looking to simplify my debt structure and reduce total cash out each month. I am looking to consolidate my 4 revolving accounts and pay off negative equity on my car to accomplish this.   I also just had a major wind storm come through my area, which damaged portions of my fence. After discussing options with my neighbor, we decided to co-operate and replace the whole thing, as it was pretty old and an insurance claim is not likely to help in this case. Instead of adding it to my credit card debt, I would like to add it into this loan. This portion is to help pay for my portion of the fence project which is an estimated total project budget of $2500.  My current credit card debt structure is as follows:  Credit Card 1: $3545 / $4500 (Credit Limit) Credit Card 2: $2927 / $5000 (Credit Limit) Credit Card 3: $857   / $1500 (Credit Limit) Credit Card 4: $597   / $3600 (Credit Limit) Total Card Balances: $7626 / $14,600 (Total Credit Limit) Total Current Payments out: $553.00 ($134 minimum payments) Consolidated Payments with this loan: $481.79   Car Balance: $13891 Car Value (Kelly Blue Book): $8,300 Total Negative Equity: $5,591 Total Current Car Payment: $365.65/month Total Car Payment after Re-Finance: $164.35 (Assuming Current 7.2% Rate)  Current Combined Payments: $918.65/month New Combined Payments: $646.14/month Total Savings: $272.21/month  I have been paying all available cash at the end of each month trying to pay this down for awhile now. This has amounted to over $900 a month in combined payments. I plan on continuing to make these payments so this loan as long as I can so it will likely be paid of early.

"To Whom It May Concern:  I am a re-entry student with four children; ages ranging from twenty-year-old to eight-years-old. I returned to school late in life. After my divorce, I decided to return to school establish a secure economic future. I initially decided to obtain a baccalaureate however, I re-discovered my love for learning and decided to apply to graduate school. I live in California and was recently accepted to the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, hence my move to Utah. I took a year off from school to study for graduate school and law school admission exams. I plan on attending law school after I complete a master's degree. The University of Utah was my first choice however, I thought I was not competitive enough (i.e. smart enough) for their program. Well after reading my admissions letter, I knew I would move. However, during that time I did not save money to move because I did not anticipate moving. The moving expenses are as follows: a moving truck, first month's rent and deposit, and household expenses during the first month of school. This is my last resort...I have to vacate my apartment by August 1st. Currently I am on a fixed income. However, I have been granted a teaching assistant job at the graduate school in Utah. ",-1

I had been making payments without fail, but my old car had a transmission breakdown that cost $3,000 to repair.  I've kept making payments but had to put other charges on the cards. <br/>I am about to be married to a man who has two teens.  Their mother walked out on them 5 years ago.  She doesn't pay support or anything, so to help my fiance and the boys, I put their travel hockey expenses on my cards.  We've done well at repaying the credit cards and not adding any further debt, but the payments are very large and the interest rates have gone up.  <br/>I have collateral...$100K equity in our home, and a new suv that is fully paid for.  I don't know enough about home loans and whatnot to try to finance a loan that way.  And frankly, I found this website, and it appears that I can pay off our debt within a reasonable time frame--which is what I want.  I don't want to have my creditors accept a ""settlement"" or to not pay them.  I'm trying to pay everyone and keep these kids playing hockey, which is their life and possibly career one day.<br/>My job is stable and I am a good and valuable employee.  I've won multiple employee awards and have been recognized for my contributions to the company.  <br/>All I want is to pay my creditors and not incur new debt.  We've stopped using any kind of credit as of last year, and only buy what we can afford to pay for.<br/>We aren't irresponsible people.  My fiance paid all his children's expenses entirely during and after his divorce, as their mother is not involved in financially supporting them what so ever.  As his wife-to-be, I've taken on the roll of supporting these boys financially, as well as emotionally, and we have a great relationship--I couldn't ask for better stepkids!<br/>I hope that someone will see that I am a good investment and I will repay this loan in full!<br/>Thank you for taking the time to consider my application.<br/> Borrower added on 05/14/10 > I apologize if my loan description seems in any way 'uneducated.'

"The purpose of this loan is 3 fold. First is to pay of a $3,000 credit card debt. The other two is for an investment/business purpose. I would use a portion of the loan to fund my existing rental property. The other investment is in a health and nutrition company that would yield immediate profit from selling products.  My parent have an auto laon that is under my name. This is because their credit is bad and wanted a lower APR. They make payment for this each and every month. I also have a rental property that I owe with my sister and brother. We split all payments equally and set aside in a seperate bank account. The total is about $200 monthly after rent is collected.   I am an excellent candidate because I have great credit history and payment for the last 7 years when I first established credit. My fico score is 736 on Equifax. My cost of living is going to change dramatically. I will be moving back with my family to once again help them out. But I am looking forward to it since it would reduce my expenses by $700-$800 monthly. This would afford me the opportunity to get the wheels of the financial fortune turning. I just need a little jump start. I work as a ""middle man"" in a restaurant, in other words, I'm a waiter and make pretty good income. Thanks for you time folks.",-1

"Monthly net income: $ 4,100. Experian rating of 714. I have had the same job for eight and a half years. HSBC raised my interest rate on a credit card from 13% to 25% a few months ago, for no reason (greed?). In the past I would have cashed in some stocks to pay for this, but this year it would just lock in my losses.  I am a good candidate for this loan because I have never missed a payment on any debt, ever.  I pay several times the minimum on all credit cards. I have paid off one credit card in the past year and will pay off three more (the closed cards) by the end of this year. My credit score is less than excellent simply because I concentrate on paying off closed cards first--for example I have balances of $1,250 (Bank of America at 9.5%), $2,450 (Wachovia at 8%), and $1,400 (American Express at 11.25%) on closed accounts. I also have a home equity loan for $15,000 at 4.5%. Open credit cards are at low rates of interest (except for my friends at HSBC!): Wachovia 11% on $900, FIA, 9.9% on 7,900 and 2.9% on 2,500; Discover, 5.9% on $1,000, 11.24% on 1,000, and almost $1,000 at no interest; National City, 13% on 10,000, and a 13% loan from Prosper for $5500.

" I am a high school teacher seeking a loan to purchase a reliable, but modestly priced car. In the past year and a half, my husband and I have paid off over $15,000 of credit card and auto debt that we slowly accrued while I was a stay-at-home mom. We were looking forward to paying the rest off by springtime, but both of our well-worn cars (over 230K miles each!) have bitten the dust within two weeks of each other. Except for a small emergency fund, all of our extra income has gone toward debt repayment, so we don’t have enough cash on hand to replace both cars at once. Standard auto loans require that the cars be 2003 or newer, and that we spend at least $7,500 on each—but that’s way more than we need or want to borrow! My credit score is excellent, so the interest rate they’ve offered is good, but I’m hoping to demonstrate for my kids some good old fashioned fiscal responsibility—by minimizing debt and working toward a more secure financial future. We’ve researched our local market, and have found that a $5000 loan-- combined with the cash we have-- will purchase two older but highly reliable cars that, if not too pretty, will get us through our daily work and school commutes safely and reliably.   Thank you for your generous consideration! D. Loving ",-1

"I am applying for this loan because I am trying to lower my credit card so I can start saving up some money.  I graduated college two years ago and have had my current job for about a year and a half.  I just  moved home, (so no rent/bills- thanks mom and dad!) and I don't have a whole lot of other expenses.  With some frugal months I could have this paid off, but I am getting married in about ten months and have been slammed with deposits, and a big dental bill for $3,000, virtually eliminating my savings.  My parents are paying for the ""big stuff"" for the wedding, but I have been picking up the deposits.  So, I am not in any way concerned with having to pay a few hundred dollars a month, I just would like to not be paying that high interest rate and would like to be saving some money on my end.   No credit card debt with a steady amount at a lower interest rate is what I am hoping for.  A monthly payment would be easily managed.  ",1

"  Borrower added on 11/03/10 > I am applying for this loan because I damaged my car by running over my mailbox, and I am not prepared to take the money out of my savings right now.  This year, I paid off 2 $5,000  60 unsecured loans early,and about $4500 in credit cards.  I have a good payment history, I believe its very important to pay back the money you borrow and to not over extend yourself.  I have another account with The Lending Club,Member_357044. That loan has  helped me consolidate some of my debt as well, but I also went above and beyond consolidating and outright paid a substantial portion off this year. I have a good history of paying back on time, if not early. The only current debt I have is my car lease, the loan I have with Lending Club now, and a credit line with citi; this loan would be the only new unsecured debt for the year.I encourage you to look my other account up, you will see that in a couple of months,January I believe, that loan will be half paid off. I encourage you to see how I have made consistent, timely payments.  As an individual that has lent money before to friends and family, I am aware of the risk you're taking. And as a borrower too, I would not want to be late on my payments because I do not want my credit to deteriorate, especially in this tight credit environment, but also,it is the right thing to do.  This money will help pay for the unexpected, costly damage to my car,and keep my liquidity in tact.  I can afford to take the money out of my account, like I said I just dont want to dig into my nest egg right now.  You can rest easy lending to me, I am reliable.<br/>",-1

"Its time to get rid of this high interest debt.  I have three credit card with high APRs.  I am just throwing money away by paying these companies loads of interest.  I know that paying off debt is a process and not an overnight miracle, so what I would like to do is tackle one of these at a time, starting with the one with the higher interest.  If this works well, then I would most likely return to the site to get another better rate loan.  I would much rather pay my fellow hard workers this money than these big time banks.   I do have the high interest on the cars because of some credit issues in the past.  Mostly stemmed from racking up debt while I was in college.  Even with the troubles I have had in the past, I have managed to bring my score to up over 700.  I've done that by not missing a payment in about 5 years, including the mortgages I have held.  My past does not reflect my habits today, or my goals for tomorrow.  I am very serious about getting rid of this debt, so I will not let you down.  Sometimes it just makes me sick.   If I can answer any questions for you, please do not hesitate.  Thanks for considering.",1

"  Borrower added on 03/22/10 > Hi.  Thank you for considering our loan.  Hereâs some more information to help you in your investment decision.  <br/><br/>Professionally, I'm a physician and have been in practice since October, 2007.  I work in a government run hospital in the Emergency Room where I have been for over 2 years.  I have a great job, and due to a recent promotion, Iâll be getting a raise soon.  <br/><br/>Personally, I am good with my money.  I live within my means and as a rule try to only borrow money for school, purchasing a new home, babies, and cars if needed.  Up until I started having children, I paid cash for my cars, but upgraded for the safety of my two young children and my wife.  We bought a home a year ago, at a good price and interest, and are current on all debt.  We owe less than market value on our home, and also we have homeowners and mortgage insurance.  The mortgage insurance is the good kind, not part of my loan, but an extra insurance that I got for security.  It would make my mortgage payment for up to a year if I were to lose my job or were unable to work.  <br/><br/>Normally, we use one credit card, which we pay off every month.  The debt we have now comes from back in residency to buy my car, which I am still driving, when we had our first child.  Other debt we incurred when we were saving to buy our current home, we used our credit cards for some purchases to increase our cash savings to buy down our loan interest rate.  And lastly, we also bought a minivan after having a second child.  (Used, low mileage, and a great price due to a few small dents).  I also have student loans and the mortgage mentioned above.  <br/><br/>Plan: We are working to be debt free.  I want to consolidate and pay off the debts mentioned above first, then pay off student loans and mortgage.  Although, I can do this with my current job alone, I am also starting a part-time second job at a private hospitalâs ER on April 16th to earn extra money to get out of debt sooner.  We do have cash in savings in reserve for emergencies.  We also have an IRA and a government retirement account.<br/><br/>I hope this extra information helps you in your decision.  I am open to answer questions if you have them.  Thanks for your interest and investment.<br/> Borrower added on 03/23/10 > I tried to answer a question from an investor and accidentally deleted it, so here's some more information based on the questions.<br/><br/>I am the sole wage earner. <br/>No Second Mortgage.  No HELOC.<br/>I'd be happy to have automatic deductions from my checking account.  <br/><br/>Although my Income from my first job is sufficient to pay all my obligations, including this loan, I am starting a second job mid April 2010.<br/><br/>My backup plan:  If I were to lose my income from my primary job, which would be unlikely as I am tenured, have already had my yearly review, and due for a bonus and $15,000/year raise due to a recent promotion (I didnât include this in my salary reported, since it isnât showing on my paycheck yet).  If the worst were to happen and I lost my primary job, I would accept full-time status on the second job, which would pay more than my primary job without the benefits.  I didnât include any income from this second job in my proposal, as I havenât started it yet.  Having a second job increases my discretionary income and gives me increased control of my income, savings and a backup plan.  I also have a savings account, a cash reserve and short and long-term disability insurance.  Lastly, my student loans are deferrable, so as part of my back up plan above, if I needed to, Iâd put them into deferment and pay off my short-term debts first.<br/><br/>I hope this clarifies.  Thanks for your interest.<br/>",1

Closing off high interest rate credit card,-1
"I am requesting this loan to consolidate debt which I am currently carrying on credit cards whose interest rates vary from 14% to 23%.  I have accumulated this debt over the past eight years, beginning with my college days and continuing into the early days of building my career.  I have been with the same company for four years now.  They own and operate eight (soon to be nine) art galleries in two states. I began working for one of their galleries as a contract photographer.  Within the first six months, I was also building their website and designing their print ads. Shortly thereafter I began doing similar work for some of their other galleries, which were located out of state. After a year as a contract employee, they offered me a full time position doing photography and web/print design for all eight of their galleries.  I am now a salaried employee, whose main focus is growing within the company and paying off my debts.  I am single, with no dependents, and believe I live a frugal life.  I rent an apartment, drive a car that has been paid off for three years and believe that until I am debt free, I have no discretionary income.  Working in the computer field and participating in the rise of social networking, I am excited to see peer-to-peer lending taking off.  I see it as a wonderful solution for both investors and borrowers, and hope to be on the other side of the table one day soon.  I believe Lending Club and their investors can help to make a huge difference in my life.  I sincerely appreciate your consideration.",1

"It took me two years out of college to find a decent paying job in my field of study.  In those two years, I had a few jobs which didn't pay particularly well and a few months of unemployment.  I relied too heavily on credit cards to fill the gaps when my job wasn't enough.  Before I knew it, I was buried in credit card debt and the rates on the majority of the debt had more than doubled.  I have since found a secure job in my field of study (which I have been at for almost two years now) and have learned to budget and stop using/relying on credit cards.  However, my debt haunts me and I would like to consolidate my three accounts into one fixed (and lower) APR so I can pay them off as soon as possible and be finished with them.    The amount requested will cover all three cards and will fit nicely into my budget.  Also, having a fixed-term loan, as opposed to the open-ended credit cards, would be a great personal relief that gives me a set date that the total debt will be repaid.  I'm still young but I'm starting to think of my financial future and I'm confident this is the first step.  ",1

"I am completing the financial proceedings of a divorce and I need to hire an attorney to negotiate the equitable distribution of the Assets. These proceeds will be used to hire the attorney and to stabilize my financial affairs.  As an additional fund-raising action, and as a risk mitigating hedge against this loan, I am also in the process of refinancing my condominium.  Its appraised value was $267,000 in 12/2006.  The target proceeds are $5,000 - $20,000.  The actual amount will depend on property appraisal.  My condo is in ""North Bethesda, MD""... approx. 4 miles North of Bethesda (an appreciating to stable market) and 6 miles South of Rockville (designated a declining market).  The need to borrow is created by timing.  I estimate that the current value of the divorce assets is approximately $200,000.  My ex-wife and I were married in the State of NC.  NC law indicates an equitable distribution should apply.  The goal is to invest up to $20,000 in hiring a competent divorce attorney to achieve the $100,000 in assets.    The assets from the divorce will be used to settle all debts.  Remaining proceeds would start a retirement fund, begin investments and be used to fund additional education. Presently I have an MBA and JD (I did pro-bono, some regulatory and in-house counsel work for startups previously, as a member of the Bar, but I do not practice law now).

"Hello!  My name is Matt Jabs.  I run the popular personal finance blog DebtFreeAdventure.com.  I have $11,000 of high interest debt left to pay off and STRONGLY desire to pay you rather than paying big banks!  I view it as a symbiotic relationship and will treat it as such.  My wife & I are both college educated professionals with solid & stable positions in our community.  I am an IT Manager and my wife works as an educator in the public school system.  We have absolutely no problem paying our bills, we are just looking to lower our rates for the remainder of our debt repayment... which you can track at http://www.DebtFreeAdventure.com.  I post monthly debt repayment & savings statements there for you to read up on and keep track of.  Another reason why we have come to Lending Club is because we just had all 3 of our remaining credit card companies raise our rates... it was the last straw!  Again, I view this as a symbiotic relationship and would much rather pay you interest than the big banks.  Well, to be brutally honest... I cannot wait to pay this off ASAP so I can PAY MYSELF interest!!  :-)    Matt Jabs Matt@DebtFreeAdventure.com (517) 969-3020",-1

"  Borrower added on 04/13/11 > GREAT MONTHLY CASH FLOW / LOOKING TO LOWER INTEREST:<br/>I currently have a Lending Club loan (you will see on my credit report) which, of course, is current.  Per my description on that loan, my plan was to refinance all my credit card debt so that I could reduce total interest and pay off more quickly.  That loan was the first half, now I am doing the second half.  Following the funding of this loan my plan is to reduce my overall open to buy by eliminating some unneeded cards. The goal here is to just refinance the debt as opposed to bringing on new debt.  My income is solid, stable and ample to make payments as I believe my profile will show.  This is primarily a move to optimize the cash that I am paying out each month and create a finite path for pay off.  Funds used to pay this loan are already being spent each month and are allocated to my monthly budget, this will just allow those budgeted dollars to work more effectively.  I have worked in the same industry for 17 years now and have had only two employers (including the current one) during that period.<br/>",1

We will be using a combination of personal income and income from the business to pay this off as quickly as possible.  This loan will be used for her to participate in an exclusive mentoring/Mastermind group as well as the re-branding and marketing of the business.

The last of the funds will be used for new business cards, advertising, etc. We take pride in maintaining the strong credit we've worked hard to achieve and our integrity.

"  Borrower added on 06/26/10 > For the past four years, I have enjoyed increasing success as a gaffer.  This means I, in conjunction with a Director of Photography (DP) determine the necessary equipment and design for lighting movies, commercials, and music videos.  Most often, I focus on commercials, both industrial (private), and advertising (public).<br/><br/>In order to perform my job, after I make an assessment of the work and equipment needed, and compile a detailed list for the production company so they may rent the lighting gear through a rental company.  <br/><br/>Over the past year, I have come to the point where I often work with the same DPs, using the same lighting set ups.  However, I still have to rent the gear.  My intent in asking for the loan is to allow me, in combination with money I've saved, to buy a small but comprehensive lighting package that will allow me to collect the rental fees from the production company into my own pocket, instead of watching the money go to some one else.  In addition to allowing me to be paid for the rentals, the lighting package will allow me to start accepting jobs I've had to turn down for lack of owning my own gear.<br/><br/>I can provide a detailed list of the equipment I intend to purchase if so desired.  In combination with some gear I already own, the rental fee I would be able to charge for my rental package would amount to $500 - $700 per day in addtition to my day rate.  The rental alone would pay for the loan after approximately 14 to 20 rental days. <br/>Each year of my career has led to more money than the last, and as of this year I have been earning an average of $4500 / month.  Although theoretically I could probably afford to borrow more than the $10k I'm asking for, I prefer this amount because in the unlikely event I were never able to rent my gear, I could still afford to both pay back the loan and continue to put money into a savings account.<br/>",8

"  Borrower added on 07/06/10 > This is my first loan request and am looking to consolidate CC debt in tune of $13,604.65 as of today's balances. My goal is to purchase our first home within six months and credit card utilization plays a big part in FICO scoring. An installment account is scored differently than CCs and this loan would result in a big bump in our FICO scores and thus place us in a better position to get a lower rate.<br/><br/>To summarize my credit reports, all are the same with up to a 13 year history (depending on the report) with an average age of approx 3-4 years. I don't know how much info you can see, but I have a total of 20 accounts on TransUnion with all but 5 being current and open with zero lates. The closed accounts include three closed and paid (in good standing) CCs that were closed due to higher rates and/or fees, and two car loan accounts. Both car loans are paid in full, with the latest being last spring and one followed me from a dark period in my credit history and was a redeemed repo. After the repo, I paid past due amounts and continued until paid in full and that was over 4 yrs ago. The repo occurred over 5 yrs ago with lates leading up to that. I believe there are seven 30 and 60 day lates reporting with the last being 1/2005. Other than that I have no other bad accounts reporting, including no judgments, collections, etc. <br/><br/>Per new credit, I have 8 inquiries reporting on TransUnion but all of them, except for one, are older than 1 yr old and are about to drop from the credit report. The most recent inquiry is 8-9 months old. This is my first and only attempt at a loan.<br/><br/>My monthly income is at $5,260 and I've been with the same company since May of 1997. I worked my way up and have served as president since the start of the year. We are in the commercial services industry (janitorial, security, landscaping, supply sales, etc.) since 1978 and are rebounding at $1.7M/yr, debt free, BTW. Not included in the stats are household income. My wife is a stay-at-home mom to 4 kids, but she earns income by serving on the board for our company. That income is at about $22k/yr. Aside from that, we earned an extra $5300 in reported misc. income last year. <br/><br/>Per DTI, our monthly obligations are the rent ($1000) and CC payments.<br/><br/>Per cash reserves, we have about $2000 in cash available at all times with $35k in a CD saved for our future home. We also have just over $20k in a 401(k).<br/><br/>One question I'd ask is why so much debt and why is your CC utilization so high? Over the past year, my wife didn't have (well, we didn't have) health insurance. Despite that, come 2 weeks ago, kiddo #4 came and we paid the hospital in cash. Felt great, but I used CCs as a crutch over the past many months. To compund things, I had over $8000 in credit with DSNB (Macys and Bloomies) and they made a change in CC reporting and stopped reporting the credit limits. That shot my CC utilization up by 35% overall in one day. Thankfully, I only had balances on two of the accounts, one of which recently got paid off and has yet to report. Last year, I added an Amex Green and funnelled all purchases on that card. That forces me to pay in full monthly all the while chipping away at the remaining CC balances (approx 10 of 20 accounts have balances). <br/><br/>I probably typed too much, but wanted to be thorough.<br/> Borrower added on 07/09/10 > I wanted to give an update...I called today and they had already received everything they needed.

"I am requesting this money so that I can move as soon as possible to a new location in Atlanta.  I moved down here from Maryland, the summer after I graduated from college. I graduated magna cum laude, ending my undergraduate career with a cumulative GPA of 3.94, and promptly obtained a full-time job with benefits upon moving to the south. While I was in school I worked part time (anywhere from 10 to 25 hours per week extra) to pay for my tuition, as well as had several jobs on campus (tutoring, and during my last year I was a Resident Assistant in one of the dorms).  Money has always been a bit tight but I put it towards my education and other necessary expenses.  It has become necessary for me to seek other residency elsewhere in Atlanta. The relationship that I moved for is failing and has become an unhealthy situation for both people. However, I enjoy my job and do not want to leave it; I am doing well at the company and enjoy working.  It's important to me now that I seek another place to live as soon as possible, even though my finances do not specifically allow for it (due to recent medical expenses). This loan would help me be able to put down a deposit on a new place to live and help me through the next few months of rent while I remove myself from this unhealthy situation. ",-1

This Loan will be used to pay off my credit card. I had my cards paid off until this autumn when I had some emergency medical issues. Even though I had insurance I still ended up with a sizeable portion that I had to pay out of pocket which I had not choice but to put on a credit card. Then my credit card company jacked my rate up to 29.99 percent. So I would rather pay interest to people than to banks and credit card companies so I thought I would try this. Thanks for Helping!!,-1

"For 25 years, our company has been a viable business, and a loyal customer of Bank of America. At the end of 2008, Bank of America cut our credit. This left us with a double-whammy. First, at the end of each year -- and the beginning of the first quarter of the following year -- there is a seasonal downturn in our business. Second, this time there was also the additional challenge of the worsening economy. Just at the time when we needed our credit the most, Bank of America pulled the rug out from under us.    The prognosis for our company is very good. Our clients are the world's biggest in the field. A $9 billion project is about to be completed, and for our clients this means thousands of units to be sold and leased. In turn, this means that our services are required, and new business thus also realized.    Consequently, ours are no ""long term"" issues. Just one of our contracts is worth many times the loan amount we are seeking.   The amount of this funding will help us fill the gap that Bank of America left for us. And that is why I am here, so that our company will continue to realize the success which it has had for 25 years.    Please feel free to ask any questions. I will gladly provide any additional details you may require.    Thank you for your consideration.  Borrower added on 05/13/10 > We have recently incorporated a new division of our company in Nevada, to take advantage of the better tax structure, and to be closer to our clients.  This will save us thousands of dollars each year on taxes, and help expand the business. The current business climate is also improving, as the economy and world markets stabilize. All of this is good news for us -- as long as we have capital to take advantage of our growth opportunities. This is the main reason for contacting Lending Club, and seeking this short-term loan.<br/> Borrower added on 05/22/10 > I was recently notified by my Credit Keeper account that as of May 18, 2010, my FICO score is at 750. I thought that members of the Lending Club, who may be interested in investing in this current loan, would like to know that. I hope this demonstrates that even under adverse conditions I am able to keep my business and personal accounts in good order, and that I always maintain my obligations in a timely manner. <br/><br/>Our company has been in business for a long time, and throughout the current economic climate -- and the credit crunch that has made business advancement difficult -- we have still maintained all activities in a professional manner. We are able to continue, and to advance, and -- with the support of the members of the Lending Club -- we will prevail. Thank you for being a part of our future.<br/> Borrower added on 05/24/10 > Here is some additional information about our company, and the work we do.<br/><br/>We are in the marketing research and consulting business. Our main task is to speak with customers, and ask them about their experiences. We ask them what they like, what they don't like -- and why. There are many different aspects to this marketing research, but in a nutshell we provide direct-from-the-customer data, and opinions, which our clients then use to improve service. <br/><br/>As the economy is improving, new areas of potential business are opening in many parts of the US, which also means that our clients are stepping up their marketing research activities. This is good for our business as we seek these opportunities, and continue to build upon them.<br/>",-1

I'm going to school to become and xray technician and currently attending a city college to get my pre-reqs out of the way and then I will transfer out.

"  Borrower added on 02/23/11 > This loan is to purchase the house and property directly adjacent to my homesteaded property (where I presently reside). I want to make a double lot and live in the next home while I have a 2 year lease with roommates that live in the present house. This way I can pay off the house at a greater pace without financial strain. The long run purpose for this action is to have a secondary home for my aging mother to live in after retirement. The house next door is on the market right now, and will be open to investors in a few days. The faster this loan goes through, the better chance I have of closing, so please hurry if possible. I plan to offer $10,000 cash (the asking price is $14,900), with the remaining funds for improvements before moving in. I have owned my present home for almost 5 years without a single late payment. I will not be moving for at least 8-10 years, so have an invested interest in both properties and the neighborhood. I pay all bills on time, and try not to over extend. I presently have approx. $1,500 in household/credit/loan bills<br/>per month with an income of $3,000 a month + $1,000 from rent = $4,000 total approx. income per month. This should pose no problems in paying the new loan on time. II been at my present job for 10 years, and do not plan on leaving any time soon.

I would like to thank all the investors who have already responded to my posted loan request. <br><br>I would like to provide more information in the hopes my full posted loan request is funded.<br><br>For five years, a snowball effect of financial mishaps and hardships has occurred. Some I could have avoided; some I could not. Bottom line, I have been unsuccessful gaining control of my debt because many of these debts are carried with high interest rates.  I have been unsuccessful negotiating lower interest rates with my creditors. I recently developed a spreadsheet listing all my debt. I had a rude awakening when I was able to see of my $721 monthly credit payments, $251 is toward interest (35%). <br><br>The purpose of requesting a $12,000 loan is to finance my high interest debt into a low interest loan. Through this loan, and paying off high interest debt, I project my monthly credit payments to be $675 with $130 towards interest (19%), allowing me the opportunity to comfortably pay off my debt in about three years. <br><br>I have been placing money into a savings account (difficult to access) for unplanned financial mishaps and hardships with the goal of avoiding the use of credit cards (I have cut them up!). <br><br>I have a secure job within a financially sound healthcare organization which I have been employed for ten years. Spring 2012, I enrolled in College with the goal of acquiring a degree in Accounting.  I am currently carrying a 3.88 GPA. I plan to graduate June 2013. Through College business classes I have learned how I CAN improve my financial situation.<br><br>I am loyal with my credit payments. However, I would prefer the opportunity to have most my monthly credit payments applied towards the principal so I can pay my debt off sooner.  Thank you so much for your time.<br>",-1

Some credit cards were at a 0% promotion and now have jumped to 24.99% APR. I am looking to consolidate my debt. My bills and rent are always paid on time. This will not only reduce my interest rate but consolidate my bills into one payment. My goal is to rent out this house as additional income on top of my full-time job. <br> Borrower added on 11/23/11 > To answer a few questions posed:<br><br>I have worked at my current place of employment for over 2 1/2 yrs.

As stated above, I have two credit cards with @24.99% APR that I would like to pay off with the 18.25% loan.<br><br>The credit cards originally had a 0% APR for cash advances. This was used for a down payment on the house. It was not from frivolous spending. Before the cash advance, my credit cards had low balances which I'd pay off before the end of the month.<br><br>As for my monthly budget:<br><br>Housing cost: about $500 + $50 util. <br>Credit Cards: $500/mos. Which would be transferred to loan payments, when CC's are paid off with loan<br>Transportation: $100<br>Food/Misc.: $300<br><br>I hope this helps. Please feel free to send further questions.

"I would like to consolidate my credit card balances into one loan that is at a reasonable, fixed interest rate (14% and under). Credit card rates fluctuate and are based on the prime rate, not fixed. I have been making good credit card payments and have never missed a payment. My credit score is great, dampened only by the fact that I am only 22 years old. Aside form that, I have been using credit lines and have never missed a payment in the 4 years as a credit using adult.  I have significant assets in real estate but they are not liquid enough to be able to use to pay off my credit cards and most banks refuse to use real estate as collateral.  I am also a 2009 college graduate and have a steady job that I have had for the last 2 years. I have been promoted with pay raise and am scheduled for another in the next couple of months.  In summation, I have the net assets to liquidate my debts but I would rather refinance at a lower, fixed rate so that I can save time and possibly money.",-1

"  Borrower added on 06/08/11 > My Plan:  I will use this loan to pay off my my credit cards and then I'm going to close them out.  I typically pay more than the minimum due but the interest rates and annual fees keep going up and the banks continue to lower my credit line.  This is impacting my debt to credit ratio, which is further impacting my credit score.<br/><br/>Stability:  I've been employed with the same company for 15 years and work in IT.  I have 2 savings accounts and a 401(k) plan that I could easily tap into and pay off all my credit card debt but that would be a last resort.  I want to stay on track with building my emergency funds and retirement savings and at the same time make regular monthly payments against my debt so I can build upon my credit worthiness.<br/><br/>The Numbers:  Currently, my monthly budget allocates $500 towards credit card payments.  The $328 monthly payment on this consolidation loan is set at a lower APR, which enables me to pay off my credit card debt in just 3 years.  At the rate I'm going, it would take at least 7 years to pay them off (longer if they continue to hike up their rates and fees!)  The $172 difference will be deposited into savings.<br/><br/>Thank you so much for your support!<br/>",1

  Borrower added on 02/25/11 > I'd like to take a moment and explain why I have applied for this loan.  <br/><br/>I have 2 credit cards and 2 checking accounts that have Lines of Credit attached.  Every month when I make payments to each credit card I have to turn around and use the credit cards to buy gas and/or groceries.  When I make payments to the Lines of Credit I have to dip into them to pay bills.   I'm not getting ahead.  I feel I'm getting buried each month with more debt.  <br/><br/>If this loan is approved I will pay off both credit cards and closing them.  I will also pay down both lines of credit and have the limits reduced.  One line has a limit of $3000.  I don't want that.  One doesn't need that much in a line of credit.  I will have it lowered to $250.  The other line has a limit of $500.  I want to pay that down and have it lowered to $100.  <br/><br/>All together I am paying $320 a month for both cards and lines.  If I am approved for this loan I would be able to catch up on my other bills and actually start putting money aside and start saving.  <br/><br/>I hope this help you understand why this loan is important to me.  Thank you for your time.  <br/><br/>Denise<br/>,1

It is a great honor for her and for the state of Mississippi since she is the first Mississippi theatre teacher at attend.  She is scheduled to attend her third and final summer this June.  There is a snag.  Due to a horrible mix up with her old collegiate student loans her financial aid for Summer 2008 was rescinded and she must pay right at $6000.00 in tuition before she can be registered this summer.  The original payment deadline is mid April, but Roosevelt has extended the deadline for us until early June. If she does not attend this summer, the courses she needs will not be offered again until summer 2012.   The final part of the program is a thesis production scheduled for spring 2010.  If she cannot attend this summer that production will be moved back until spring 2013.  All of the students who have begun preparation for the 2010 production will have graduated and will have lost their opportuniy to shine in this historic production.

"I am a single family home investor in South Texas and have been buying, selling, leasing and financing houses in 3 counties in and around San Antonio for over 10 years.  In fact, my first investment was some 18 years ago.  I am currently looking for private investors to fund Real Estate investments and trades (flips).  I off private investors 2 to 3 times CD rates on 60 to 70% loan-to-value secured investments.  Given our current RE and banking environment, opportunities are abundant in my area for the Real Estate business owner.   In fact potential deals are being discarded because too many projects can be counterproductive.  But with all these great deals, comes a greater need for working capital.   The high number of good deals available right now has created a need for a little extra working capital.  I have 2 rehab projects in progress right now and could use a little cushion to complete 2 rehab projects.   I am looking for opportunities to create some long term relationships with the right individuals.     This is a great opportunity for a lender (you) to earn a good rate of return and know that this money is being put into income producing properties - much more secure than debt consolidation, investing in a new business venture, or buying a depreciating product.  Those are all worthy loans, but if an investment is tied to a project to create more income or capital, then the loan (in my opinion) is quite strong.  I've recently gone from part time to full time investor; my passive income has not quite replaced my W2 income, but w/ the houses in the pipeline and 2 more sales of existing inventory, then replacement of the W2 income is assured.  Additionally, my wife is retired military and full time government contractor in San Antonio and has a very stable job, repayment a loan of this size, is not difficult.  Future and more sizeable loans with lenders desiring secured investments can be offered Notes w/ Trust Deeds.  ",-1

The credit cards are:  Citibank $17,000 APR 29.9% (we will be paying off $10,000 of this next week and the balance consolidated); Capital One $17,000 APR 29.4% (this will be consolidated).  Other debts include Capital One $18,000 APR 15.9%, which the business will continue to pay, Sears $1,500 will be paid off next month by the business and First Community $5,000, which will be paid off in September by the business.  The business is construction related so due to several hurricanes and the state of the housing market the credit card debt crept up since we had to continue paying normal operating expenses.  The market is coming back and the business is busy again.  Even in slow times we were still able to make the minimun payments on the debt but obviously not getting anywhere as far as paying it off.

"  Borrower added on 10/29/10 > Hi all,<br/><br/>Thanks to those who have already invested, and I hope to answer the questions posed by a few of you with regards to current debt/expenses.<br/><br/>I currently have no mortgage, auto, or school loans independent of my credit/consumer debts.  I am the sole wage earner and have no children or child care expenses.  I do currently have enough in 401K to NOT take out a loan, but don't want to go the cash-out route for a number of reasons (tax purposes and retirement considerations at the very top of that list).<br/><br/>The credit debt is a mixture of consumer purchases, auto repairs, medical, dental, and veterinary bills, plus (honestly), some fun and vacation expenses.<br/><br/>I am paid an hourly rate at my primary job (employed there for 6 years, this month), and my minimum net income is approximately $3100/month and will max out at approximately $3800/month net, depending on the available overtime.  <br/><br/>Here are my approximate outstanding debts/interest rates/monthly payments (I've been attempting to pay beyond the minimum every month on the higher rates, as I can):<br/><br/>acct1 $14360 /  20.01% / $330<br/>acct2 $11873 / 16.65% /  $330<br/>acct3 $1046 / 16.99% /  $100<br/>acct4 $5846 / 22.99%/  $300<br/>acct5 $3922 / 26.24% / $150<br/><br/>TOTAL consumer debt expenses: approximately $1210/month<br/><br/>This loan would allow me to completely pay off the three highest-interest balances (&gt;20%).  Those are amazingly not penalty rates!  I do have a large sum debt, but I earn a decent wage and never submit a late payment.  This is important to me personally.<br/><br/>This loan would allow me to reduce my overall interest rates by quite a bit, and pay this down at a much more aggressive schedule, while paying slightly (~$25) less per month than I'm doing now.  As I said, I do make enough now to pay my bills on time every month, but I'm not making near enough progress, and am not able to build up decent savings beyond 401K.  <br/><br/>As a side note, I'd like to also mention that I've recently done a few things to help my myself regardless of the outcome of this loan.  I've cut my TV service and gym membership entirely (savings of $190/month) and picked up a second, part-time job this month.   This job will increase my income by approximately $500-$600/month, a positive swing in my favor.<br/><br/>That leaves the following expenses:<br/>-rent, $1075/month<br/>-gas and electric, approx $35/month combined<br/>-cell phone, approx $150/month<br/>-internet, $30/month<br/><br/>TOTAL monthly expenses (consumer debt listed above included): approx $2500/month<br/><br/>There hasn't been a great deal left after groceries, gas/auto, and any entertainment, so as I said, it's been a challenge to save and pay this debt down at a decent rate at all.<br/><br/>I feel like this is a very doable thing for me and could do it on my own regardless, but the opportunity for the loan here would save me quite a bit of money and put me on a much more favorable timetable, and I'm very excited to get started on this and pay these debts.  Again, thanks for those who have invested their help already, and to those who have expressed enough interest to ask for more info.  Sorry for being so wordy, but I wanted to be thorough.  Thanks again.<br/>",1

Therefore, I will leave a description that is actually honest and real because that's really all there is.    Frankly, this whole process--talking to banks, looking at various lines of credit and doing research--has been somewhat disheartening and what I previously wrote was a sarcastic, pessimistic version of that.  Most of my debt (as I'm sure is the case with many other borrowers on this site) comes from student loans.    Currently, I'm in grad school full-time and I work full-time which doesn't always seem to present well for banks.  However, I'm not your typical student.  I have excellent credit and I ALWAYS pay my bills on time, but I just happen to enjoy learning and have not reached the point in my life yet where my ""ideal job"" is attainable (doctorate here I come).    I wish I could say that I had the job and career (even kids) which would allow me to settle down, but I've still got a little ways to go before any of that comes to fruition.    As far as the military goes, they have paid for a decent portion of my education (which I am extremely greatful); however, anyone who is familiar with how Tuition Assistance works knows that they certainly don't pay for everything.    I can't complain, I've been given a great opportunity to continue my schooling and not everyone gets that chance.  Still, I could use some help because I desprately want to simplify the rest of my life by consolidating all of those loans into one place.   Thank you in advance.",-1

"I will use the loan funds for home improvements to increase the value of my property and also dramatically reduce my heating and cooling costs for a long time to come. The loan is for installing a Solar Thermal HVAC system as well as adding a bathroom and bedroom to my home.  This loan will be used to help make a great investment that will payback for itself in terms of the savings to monthly utility bill (>$300) and the value it will add to the property. According to the NAHB (National Assoc of Home Builders), addition of a bathroom and bedroom can each add 10%-20% to a home???s value. In addition the Solar Thermal HVAC will also add value to my home. In total these improvements can increase the value of my home by over $40,000 this year.

"""Hello,      After graduating from college, I took an opportunity to start my own business operating a self-funded music publishing and recording company. And during the 5 years of my success in the public eye, most likely due to my lack of experience and preparedness, financially I made a few errors in judgment.      Since then I have been doing everything I can to improve my financial situation: I got a very good job at the University of California, San Diego managing several projects in Medical Education (4 years currently); I???ve been pushing aggressively for promotions at work (about 1 month away from the latest approval); I am currently in the pursuit of a second job;  I have been and continue to sell items of value in order to supplement any income; To save money on gas, I bike to work on average 1-2 times per week (approximately 50 miles round trip); and most importantly, I have turned music into a more realistic and financially stable hobby.      Below is the detail of the debt that I am hoping to consolidate.   I plan on eliminating 3 of the 4 cards.   In the years that I have had this debt, I have been late on payments maybe once or twice (occasions where I overlooked the date).  Also, a little less than one-third of this debt was built from the assistance of pursuing my bachelor???s degree.        * indicates the credit I intend on eliminating with this assistance      Card 1  $3902.38 (%15.24)      * Card 2  $3955.99 (%17.90)      *Card 3  $13,475.70 (%24.50)      *Card 4  $4777.13   (%27.74)      I appreciate any help that is out there and look forward to getting out of this hole so I can finally be able to focus on moving forward with building a family and career.

"I want to buy a small diner that is for sale in wealthy neighborhood in NY. I am working with a broker and found a really nice diner in a very nice area. It is a well established restaurant earning $6,000/week for breakfast and lunch with the potential for monetary growth. Once, I received the information from the broker about the restaurant, I visited the restaurant and ate there.  I really enjoyed the food and the service was great! The place was almost full and there was a diverse crowd. The current owner recently began a Sunday breakfast and is adding a dinner menu. Although the primary sales are from food, an application for a liquor license has also been submitted which will improve monetary sales. I honestly believe that this place can do a lot better with more advertising. There are three colleges nearby and the current owner have not taken advantage of it. I will use social networks such as facebook.com, myspaces.com and others as well as special discounts and WIFI internet connection to attract the college crowd. The restaurant has a website, but does not offer online orders. I will change the website so people in the area can also order online.  The restaurant has great reviews online already which should bring customers to the restaurant.  I will also increase the amount of advertising in local papers and distribute leaflets to attract more customers. I will update the menu and offer more food. This restaurant has a successful operation records and the place was established in 1986. The area is surrounded by really nice houses, many offices, a mall, and plenty of parking. I drove around and this is definitely a wealthy neighborhood and people can afford to eat out on a regular basis at a restaurant like this one.  Facilities: 2050 SF plus a full basement. The restaurant cans seats 65 in the dining room.   About me:  I graduated from Hobart and William Smith Colleges in upstate New York (www.hws.edu) with a major in Economics and a minor in International Relations.  My educational background, personal experience and career interests has equipped me with the tools to run this business. It has always been my dream to own and run a business and this is a great starter place. I am confident that I can successfully bring this business to the next level. I am currently working as Legal Assistant at a large Financial Company. I am quite accomplished in dealing with a diverse group of individuals from a wide array of backgrounds.  My current salary can cover the loan in case the restaurant does not produce what I am projecting. ",8

My payments on these cards totals $60 dollars a month. Overall, I am a competent, hard working person, who is on top of his credit. Thank you for your time.<br/>",-1

"Purpose of loan:  This loan will fund the expansion of my side consulting business.  I am a successful software engineer with 10 years experience, 5 in a big corporation, 5 as a consultant.  I have a full time consulting position but I run an additional side consulting business in a different market and therefore do not compete with my employer.  This loan will pay for lead generation and conversion, marketing materials, and escrow for subcontractors.  After many months of research and study I have determined the best ways to scale my side consulting business using less of my time and efforts.  I will expand through referral systems, passive income products such as information products and software components, and outsourcing development to qualified teams in India, Russia, etc.  My financial situation:  Don't be alarmed by my high revolving balances.  It is essentially a wash.  Whenever I receive a 0% introductory rate on a credit line, I take the money and write out-of-the-money uncovered puts at 30% equity in my brokerage account.  When the introductory rate is close to expiration, I pay the credit line back.  Unlike this loan, the good rates typically only last 6 months.  I have strong character and uphold all my obligations.  I have never missed a payment in my life. This includes the 18 month period when I had a parent near death with cancer surgeries, had my first child with my wife after being cheated out of health insurance ($50,000 loss there even though we're all perfectly healthy and had a perfect delivery), moved from one state to another, and sold two houses (I owned a rental property).  I am an outstanding investment and you can't go wrong here! ",1

"Almost two years ago, I took out a $20,000 loan with Bank of America to consolidate my high interest credit cards.  At the time I had just purchased my condo (1st time home buyer) and I needed to renovate and furnish my new home.  After almost 18 months of on time payments and extra payments totaling over $10,000, Bank of America refuses to lower my 18.99% interest rate and I've only made a $5000 dent in the principal.  They say I'm a risk because of too much unsecured debt.  I have 42 payments left on thsi loan and I would like to get a much better interest rate at 36 months. If I can save 2 points on a 3 year loan, it will save me about $3000.  Please help.  Thanks  Mike",-1

It's not uncommon to have several months where we operate at a net loss. My father is 63 and his health is debilitating, so he cannot even consider a career change. They are struggling desperately for money, and have run out of alternatives as their bills pile up.<br/><br/>I would be a good borrower for this loan because I have perfect credit - no late payments and everything is paid on time. In human relations, I value integrity and credibility above all else. If I owe someone, I do everything in my power to make sure it's paid back. Honor is important.<br/><br/>My monthly take-home is about $3,000. Car payment is $213.88, student loans total $147.15. Monthly expenses total about $600. I don't spend very much money and am definitely capable of making the monthly payments on this loan. If there is any doubt, my sister just finished her third year of medical school so there may be a spike in household income within the next two years.<br/><br/>I have a very stable job as Assistant Vice President of Marketing and play an integral role in my company's business operations. I report directly to the President, and she trusts me with many important decisions that affect the company's bottom line. All things held constant, I will be with them for a very long time.<br/><br/>Thank you for considering my loan listing. Please contribute! Anything you lend would be helping a family in need.

The location of the addition requires us to do that first - that is not the order we would have chosen, but we will not be able to get to it with equipment after the pool is in. We also need a pretty extensive retaining wall which has to be done at the same time as the other projects.  We are looking at a solar thermal heater for the pool and also adding solar electric to our home.  The incentives are very good right now.  We have been planning this and saving for a couple of years and had hoped to get more out of our home equity, but ended up piecing together the funding. We have about 3/4 of the funding and this loan will allow us to set a start date.<br/>",10

Thankfully I was promoted a couple of years ago and can now afford my expenses and have been steadily paying down my debt; in fact I have stopped using credit cards almost entirely and have paid down 35% of my previous debt.  I was finally able to start going back to school this semester at my local community college and I hope to get my bachelor's A.S.A.P.  but  I will need to get the debt monkey off my back before I can start saving for further education.

"  Borrower added on 09/04/11 > Outdoor lifestyle apparel is a rapidly growing segment of the retail industry. Some of these products that are particularly tailored to coastal fishermen and outdoor enthusiasts have seen tremendous growth in popularity in the coastal regions. Many retailers carry these products all across this area, but few offer any selection of size. Some offer outdated models and prints while others just carry a fairly limited supply. Most of the customers in this region have never had the opportunity to see and purchase the vast selection of merchandise that these popular brands offer. That is where our business comes in.<br/><br/>Our company is a retail store that is designed to provide the coastal outdoor apparel and merchandise that so many people seek in one of the region&rsquo;s premier retail centers. Our collection of the most popular brands will be the largest selection in this area by far. We plan to offer the biggest selection so that every customer who has a passion for these brands will only think of one place for their coastal outdoor apparel needs: us. In a market with a lot of competitors we plan to stand out by being completely devoted to this segment. This is a niche market, and we plan on being the retailer that can serve this niche market the best. We plan on focusing on this market segment and providing a depth in product line with which other retailers cannot compete while staying competitive in pricing. Since we will carry the largest selection of products from these wholesalers, we will be able to compete with even the big retailers on price. With competitive prices and the largest selection in the area, we are confident that we will be the preferred choice of many of the customers who love these brands and apparel.<br/><br/>Our store concept is one of a kind. While there may be similar stores in other geographical areas, there are no stores of this nature and this size in this region. With this uniqueness we plan to further differentiate ourselves from the competition by the way we do business. We plan to have a simple nautical and fishing theme as our store d&eacute;cor, something very different from other retailers. Our staff is to be friendly and attentive to help our customers in whatever they need. We also realize that although much of our clothing apparel is targeted to males, females do the majority of shopping and purchasing in a typical family. That is why we will make an effort to reach out to these customers with a large selection of women&rsquo;s coastal apparel that cannot be matched elsewhere. We have a passion for these clothes and brands ourselves. When people are passionate with what they do and what they sell, their passion is evident. With our selection of brands, depth of product lines, emphasis in customer service, good location, and a passion in what we do and sell, we are set to become the retailer of choice for coastal outdoor enthusiasts.<br/><br/>I will gladly answer any questions about the business in a timely manner. My formal education background is a Bachelor's degree in Business Management with a concentration in Entrepreneurship from the University of Alabama. I have years of experience in management, retail, and customer service.<br/>",8

I am going to use this loan to pay off all my credit card debt and my student loans. I bring home 3200 a month and my rent is 1200. I do not own a car so the rest of the $2,000 will be mostly my own.  I plan to make much larger payments than the required $450 per month. I actually plan to pay $700 a month minimum. I have never paid any credit card late.  I would like to make 1 monthly pmt per month instead of my current 5.<br/> Borrower added on 06/24/10 > Additional Information<br/>My credit card payments currently total about $400 a month and my student loan is $520 a month.  The loan amount is for $19,000 but my credit card balance is 10,718.  The extra ($8,282) is going to bed used to pay off the student loans.   Sounds ambitious but my goal is to pay off the loan in 2 years.  I selected the 60 month option to allow for flexibility but plan to tutor next school year to speed up payments on the loan.<br/>",1

I am a good borrower because I don't do it often and wouldn't be doing so now if paying off my trips wouldn't stretch my budget too thin.  I have no vehicle payment so my monthly budget mainly consists of a house payment and a credit card bill (paying off my oldest son's college spending), as well as reasonable utility expenses.

As for job stability, I have been in the same job position since 1993, although my school has only been open for 5 years.

Her career choice, not mine, but admirable nonetheless..<br/><br/>Nearly all of our debt is related to the birth of our 3rd son which was a blessing but not planned.  We agreed that taking a year off work made sense for her given her salary and the cost of daycare for 3 children.

We also took advantage of the home buying credit to purchase a larger house in December of 2009 and even though we got a great deal we still had to purchase several major appliances and out of pure convenience used high interest credit cards to do so.<br/><br/>We're finally rounding the turn and getting past the cost of daycare and diapers, not to mention the 3 surgeries to have tubes placed in the little ears and having tonsils removed.  We have 3 beautiful, healthy little boys (7,4, and 3) and look forward to planning towards saving for their future.

"  Borrower added on 02/20/11 > One year from now, my boyfriend and I are planning to open a yoga studio business.  We plan to get an SBA loan for $50,000 and put $10,000 of our own money into the business.  We currently have $3000 cash saved.  We have no credit card debt.  I have been a server/server trainer at SteakNShake since early December of 2009.  I make around $10/hr in combined hourly wage and tips.  I work around 24 hours per week.  My boyfriend is a yoga instructor and manager of a yoga studio.  He takes home $850-$870 every 2 weeks.  We take home $2800-$2900 per month.  Our monthly expenses are about $2280 per month, so we are able to save $520-$620 per month.<br/><br/>We bought my FICO scores a couple of days ago.  My scores are 769 and 757.  We have a business plan and 5 year projections for the yoga studio.  I am going to community college full time, and I will receive about $1000 for living expenses from the college.  We get back around $6500 from taxes since we have two small children. <br/><br/>In the next 12 months we plan to save $520-$620 per month ($6240-$7440 over 12 months) and also save next year&rsquo;s tax return money and the extra college money (another $7500).  So without a loan, we plan to have our current $3000 plus another $13,740-$14,940.  That makes $16,740-$17,940 saved 12 months from now.  <br/><br/>We read the Lending Club prospectus and looked at their requirements and how they handle loans.  We like the fact that they are up-front about how they calculate interest rates and select worthy borrowers.  The extra $7350 loan we are requesting (or $7130 after closing fees) will enable both my boyfriend and I to quit our jobs about a year from now for a few months in order to start the yoga studio in a financially safe and conservative way.  Our loan payments through Lending Club will be around $230 per month.  This loan will allow us to have a little over $20,000 saved in the next 12 months.  The installment loan will look good to the SBA as we make consistent, timely payments.  We will then put $10,000 cash into the business, request a $50,000 SBA loan with a solid business plan, and have another $10,000 available to pay over 4 months of living expenses while we start and grow the yoga studio business.<br/><br/>Thanks for your consideration.<br/>",-1

"  Borrower added on 08/11/10 > Since Congress subjected credit card companies with more restrictions, they in turn went after the card holders. I had two credit cards with high credit line amounts cut down to just above the current amount owed (such as $21,000 to 10,900 and it drops every time I pay another 500 off). This ratio of total credit line to amount owed was always an emergency buffer in case of unforeseen expenses. This also affected my credit rating (was 730 a year ago) by lowering the owed to available ratio). I have a few expenses such as car repairs and a small garage roof leak which I'm putting off due to not enough credit card balance. I also have a few doctor bills (after the insurance paid their portion) for when my wife had a hospital visit due to a heart issue. I would use the money to pay these several small amounts and also pay off a few small amounts on store/gas/Dell credit accounts. The remainder would be kept in the bank as reserve so I wouldn't need to use a credit card and I can concentrate on paying them down to improve my credit rating.

I have been able to successfully pay off significant home-related debt (initial remodeling, plumbing replacements, etc) in less than a year following 2 promotions (one with my civilian job, the other with my military reserve career) and I'm benefiting from yet another overseas deployment, so I want these things gone!  This will free up cash to finish paying off another debt in the next 90 days before returning to the US.  Excellent payment history - I see no need to stick with a store card (Sears, 17%, used to replace roof on home thus increasing value of property; purchased at $210K in 2009) and a regular credit card (Chase, 23%, they raised it years ago and I have never been able to argue them down, regardless of impeccable payment history and credit score).  I opted for the short-term 3 year loan; I see no need to extend payments if you don't need to.  I appreciate Lending Clubs ease of use, so I opted to use LC again (I have a current loan at 6% for an emergency pool cave in/repair last summer) after failing to find another option that can compare to the quick financing, initial interaction with potential lenders (Q&amp;A when initially funding the loan), and competitive rates.  Other options on the web did not meet the threshold to satisfy the two debts I listed above, or their interest rates were equally abysmal.  I hope this answers some questions up front.

As a 25 year old single parent of 1 daughter, I am trying to clean up my credit report to buy a new vehicle for us to get back and forth in. I will need a good interest rate and a low monthly payment. Being relieved of all the credit card debt will insure this as well as insure that my daughter and I will have decent transportation for the next 5 years. I have more than one business and transportation should be the least of my worries. I don't deserve a high interest rate. I would like to thank you for all your help and may God bless you and your family.   Yours Truly,   Charnel Rene Everly",1

"Purpose of loan: This loan will be used to pay off all my outstanding bills.  I want to pay down my debt quicker, and a loan from LendingClub will help reduce my interest charges.   My financial situation: I am a good candidate for this loan because I am financially stable.  I have a well paying and stable career with the leading CTI company. I am currently paying all my loans on time and more than minimum payments, but I want to reduce the actual interest I am paying.   I haven't missed a payment with any of my lenders and my career is moving up steadily.   I have had credit history for 4 years and never missed a payment, but I guess that's not enough for the automated systems to validate my history.  As I've been on time and more than capable to pay my loans, I think that I have not been graded by capability to repay my loans, but simply because I have not had a long history of credit. ",-1

"To Whom It May Concern: I am applying for this loan in order in to close a sudden and unforeseen gap in my wedding budget in one consolidated act of borrowing that best protects the long term fiscal health of myself and my soon to be wife. If approved for this loan the funds will be directed right into paying the remaining balance on our catering bill, covering the remaining venue rental any additional unexpected expenses that may come.  The wedding will cost us $12,000 from the rehearsal dinner to the last dance, well below the national average even with the 160 guest we expect to attend.  We had been promised a contribution $6,000.00 up until this past week from a family member, and had no reason to believe otherwise but however due to a sudden and unforeseen hardship, the money is no longer available to us with but weeks left.  With attendees flying in from Japan, Guyana, England, and not to mention all over the country so canceling is out of the question and with such little time our options are limited.  Collectively we do have about $8,000 of credit available to us via credit cards with extremely high interest dwarf those quoted for this loan. My second option would have been to cash out 1000 vested stock options from my employer which yield $6,000 to $7,000 after taxes.  However given the rapidly strengthening performance of the stock, potential new product launches in exclusive markets and a steady stream of buyout chatter from the internet this would also be a very foolish course of action.  I am a QC microbiology technician at a biotech firm that is rapidly expanding its foot print and operations in the area.  I have been working at firm for five years, and make a base salary of $43,000.00 a year and can usually expect to earn an additional $4,000.00 to $7,000.00 a year in overtime and bonus.  My fiancÃ©e is a Technical writer at a specialty Financial Software firm located in Downtown Boston, currently in her second year of employment.  She has a base pay of $55,000.00 and a scheduled yearly bonus that ranges between 10-20% of her annual salary.     We are financially stable and will be quite able to make our loan payments with very little difficultly.  We would have had very little issue paying for this event had we known that this rather large some was not going to be available to us, and because of the short time remaining.   Many thanks  ",6

My husband and I both work to  pay for rent and bills (including  a student loan) and to support our 3 children. Our cars are getting older and need repairs and new tires.  We have been putting off these repairs but cannot put them off any longer. I would like to borrow just a bit of money to help cover these expenses. It would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.     ,-1

" I intend to pay off  my credit cards. I have a full time job as a fire fighter; and a part time job working at a big box home improvement store with an average of 30hrs a week. I've more than doubled monthly payments and also made an extra payment per month in the past. Its just that my payments were spread over three cards so it doesnt feel like I was redusing the debt as fast as i'd like.  Considering this economy, I believe I have one of the few careers where the thought of getting laid off is close to nill and it also provideds substancial pay increases over the span of my career.  In the past I received a loan of 5K and change that was paid off earlier than the 18 months while I only had one job. ",-1

I had an account with Bank of America which I payed off in full.  Apparently they added finance charges of $3.98 which accrued between me getting the bill and paying off the balance.  They never sent me another statement and I had no idea that I had such minimal balance.  No one from the company contacted me and I didn't realize any of this was going on until I pulled a credit report and saw this.  I payed off the balance and asked the company for some answers and got no where.  This has been a very frustrating sitution and I hope it doesn't affect my chances of getting fully funded.  I have learned my lesson and I do not want to have credit card balances with any of these major banks.,-1

"This money will go to consolidate debt payments and 1 slightly major purchase.    The debt is from credit cards that I used while in college which have all seen increases in the interest rates to very high levels.  In the past I had not worried so much about the card interest or making lump payoffs in order to keep my primary checking in good order.  The card companies have made the obvious mistake jacking up my interest (IMO)... I hope to pay investors of this loan a ""fair"" amount of interest instead and leave them with none.  I am currently paying around $500/month to the various cards to avoid paying a ton of interest.  About $3000 will take care of this debt.  A consequence of paying on debt is that I've only saved about $1000 in the past 8 months.  Therefore the other portion of this money will be going towards moving forward in a relationship (engagement).  I feel I am a good candidate for this loan.  I do have school and auto debt but it is very manageable.  I also hold a good paying job as an engineer in a very stable industry.  If there are any doubts or I have left something important out, please feel free to ask and I will enlighten you.",1

"  Borrower added on 09/22/10 > I have been at my government job for over 12 years.  I own several rentals, one paid for, one will be paid for in three years.  I have been a landlord for ten years and truly enjoy it and have never had the issues so far that other landlords complain of (knock on wood). I also am a realtor on the side for my coworkers and friends.  I would love to decorate my new home and fix a couple of small things, but running up credit cards with high interest rates isn't appealing to me.  The company I had a home equity loan with on one of my rentals, which I took out when I lived there, went bankrupt, so that home equity is no longer available to me, and they don't give home equity loans on rental properties, which if it's paid for, I really don't understand.  My job is very stable, my life is very stable (knock on wood), and I would like to use this loan to pay off what I have used on credit cards so far to decorate and, like I said, fix a few small things around the house.  I have always paid my credit cards off, but the decorating had ended up being more than I expected.  On the very few times I have carried a balance on credit cards, I have always paid way more than the minimum payment.  The payment on this loan will actually be less than what I'm currently paying on the cards, because I do pay over the minimum balance, and it will be paid in three years, rather than dragging it out forever on credit cards.  I had a loan recently to put a new bathroom in a rental and it was a one year no interest loan, and I paid that almost $5,000 loan off within the one year so I wouldn't have to pay the interest.<br/>",1

"  Borrower added on 05/29/11 > My plan is to purchase a DVD Now kiosk.  This is the perfect business investment loan to invest in for many reasons:<br/>1.  Managing a DVD Now Kiosk does not require me to quit my full-time job.<br/>2. DVD Kiosks are growing faster than any other vending opportunity in the market today.<br/>3. DVD Now competes with Red Box by offering Blue Ray and video games, which Red Box does not offer. Also Red Box only works with large chains like Wal-Mart.  My plan is to put Kiosks on college campuses, which Red Box doesn't touch.<br/>4. DVD Kiosks are set to explode.  Brick and mortar stores are closing and are being replaced by Kiosks which are much cheaper to run, yet can still bring in almost as much revenue.<br/>5. Investing in DVD Kiosks now is like investing in ATM machines in the early 80s, we are now in the ground floor stage.<br/>6. I have a degree in business, and over 7 years of sales, route sales, and inventory management experience.  All of which will help me with this endeavor.<br/>7.  Red Box kiosks have 3 revenue streams, as opposed to Red Box's one: rentals.  With a Red Box Kiosk, every time a customer rents a DVD, Blue Ray Disk, or Video Game, they are presented with the option to purchase.  Also DVD Now provides advertising space on their kiosks, which provides the kiosk owner with a steady monthly stream of income.<br/>",8

"Dear Lenders,  I am seeking to manage and eliminate my current credit card debt in as short a time as possible. In the past two years, I have eliminated almost two-thirds of the debt I had accrued during and after college, as well as the credit card debt that I had accumulated while furnishing my home.  It is time for me to eliminate the last of my credit card debt, and it would, in my estimation, be most prudent to do so by means of a debt consolidation loan. In addition to eliminating my current credit card debt in a more manageable and sustainable way than exhausting my available cash flow each month, I also intend to utilize some of the monthly cash flow that this loan would ""free up"" in order to make small repairs and improvements to my home which will increase its value and position it better within the local housing market for sale at such a time when it becomes prudent to sell.  The purpose of this loan, again, is to help me eliminate the remainder of my unsecured debt in a manageable and sustainable way, such that I do not find myself in credit card debt again in the future.  Thank you for your consideration.",0

"My company is Silver Lining Investment Properties LLC, and we have been in business since 2007 buying and selling residential houses.   We buy bank owned houses at .40 to .50 cents on the dollar and then resell them to retail buyers and investors for .80 cents on the dollar. It is great to see new home owners in an affordable house with pre-existing equity. Our company runs about 3 to 5 properties at a time.   Since the current credit meltdown our business lines of credit with two of our banks and loan programs have disappeared. We now need to reinvest most of our profits to fund any new properties we purchase, which is fine, but ties up a lot of our cash and is keeping us from expanding our business.   This loan would help us with a down payment on a great property deal in Portland, Oregon. We just had an offer accepted by Umpqua Bank for $225,000 and need to put 20% down to get financing or $45,000.  We are investing $34,000 of our own cash for the down payment and still need $11,000 to meet the 20% down payment requirement of $225,000. The property is valued at $399,000 which is very conservative market price; two comparables on the same street have sold for about $425,000 in the last 2 months. It is in a great neighborhood by great schools, and it is too good of an opportunity to pass up.  -The loan will be paid off in 6 months to 1 year, after the house is sold or refinanced.

"  Borrower added on 05/27/10 > I am an experienced certified elementary school teacher who will use the funds to open up a Drama Kids International Franchise in NW Phoenix, AZ; it will be the first in the state. I will offer after-school drama classes to students from K-12th grade in the local schools and community centers. The program will be tuition based, open to any student, no auditions required. The program teaches students how to think creatively, it promotes good speech/communication skills necessary for the boardroom or on stage. The students will participate in improvisational lessons as well as voice and creative movement. The lessons are also geared to help students build their self-confidence levels.<br/> I have an excellent credit rating and have never had any late payments or slow pays. I anticipate a monthly operating budget of $5,000.00-$8,000.00, which equates to 100-150 students at tuition of $600.00 per year to be paid in 3 installments of $200.00 each plus registration fees, to begin with once the program is underway in August 2010. Students will be able to enroll throughout the year at a prorated rate and therefore I anticipate the enrollment numbers to increase and likewise the monthly operating budget. My goal is to have 200 students within the first year of operations. I will be granted 20 sites (schools/community centers of my choosing) within my Northwest Phoenix territory, where I can deliver services. The business will be run out of my home office saving overhead costs. I will be required to pay 9% in royalty fees and a 1% national advertising fee from all of my profits to the franchise headquarters.<br/>",-1

We've gotten an amazing amount of use out of it but we will need to be sure to get a reliable vehicle before that one gives out. We hope to be able to donate it with some life left in it to a local non-profit. That is what we have done in the past with our old cars.  Our mechanic will help us find a used car in great shape for around $10,000. We have saved about half of that but we really need to make a purchase soon.

"I am starting a dance club in the heart of the Seattle U-District, 2 blocks from the University of Washington.   I have already saved $5,000 in an attempt to meet the SBA requirements of 20% collateral of the SBA. However, not many banks are willing to lend to a business where the main source of revenue is the sale of tobacco, even more a startup.  We already have the entire business plan and marketing plan ready to show to investors so you know your investment will be returned. In that business plan you'll find conservative sales estimates built from the ground up and a gross profit margin of 89-92%.   Currently we have a location ready on the main street in the U-District and are awaiting financing in order to make an offer on the space. There are no other dance clubs in the U-District where 18+ students and residents can attend. Furthermore, there are no other venues that serve Hookah. We have an untapped market with over 45,000 daily attendees in our target market with even more in the local area.  Our executive team includes Sean, a UW business graduate who is currently helping grow Seattle based marketing company, also a startup. He has extensive marketing education and experience promoting to the target market. Sean has a credit score of 720 and has never made a late payment on any of his loans. Our other founder, also named Sean, has a technical background and extensive experience running a hookah lounge in another college-based venue in Bellingham, WA. Our third member is also a business graduate and a DJ from Chicago, with over 200 shows in the mid-west scene.  Our payback period is conservatively 12-18 months in order to help cashflow, but anticpate repayment within 10-12 months.  The bulk of the requested loan will go to working capital and a 4 month lease reserve, together ~$16,400. The remaining funds will go toward inventory, furniture, and a sound system. Because the club operates only from 8pm-2am, Thursday-Saturday, both founders will remain in their current full time employment to ensure additional cashflow if needed.  Our goal is to soft-open on August 28th with a grand-opening on September 19th, 2009.  Please send any and all questions, I will be more than happy to ellaborate",8

"A bit about me: I have a master's in math from NYU, and I'm currently making over $96,000 a year working as a web developer. I also run my own web design business, which has become more successful and I am looking to expand -- purchase more equipment, and hire one web developer to work with me.  I decided to get a loan for two reasons:   1) to provide a safety net for me to expand my business. I am currently getting larger projects than I have in the past, and I will need to get another person to help me finish them. Once these projects are done, this investment should pay for itself.  2) I want to establish a lending history with installment loans so that in the future, banks will be able to lend me greater amounts than I am asking for now.  Over the past five years, I have always paid my credit cards on time and that earned me ... well, a score of 729 on Experian, (766 and 768 on TransUnion and Equifax), so I guess you can see I'm a pretty low risk.

"I would like to buy some equipment for my salon and do some construction to help with the expansion. My salon is incorporated under an independent contractor booth rental model. I have 8 stylists that pay $200 per week to work in the salon. The salon grosses $6400 per month, and the net is about $2900 per month, which is $34,800 per year after rent and utilities. I would like to add more styling stations and equipment which will help to generate more net income.  I am also employed full time for the government and my salary is $48,000 per year. I bring home about $3900 per month after payroll deductions and taxes, but this amount does vary depending on how many hours I work, and overtime, etc.  I do not have any other expenses for the salon because the stylists which are independent contractors are responsible for purchasing their own items and supplies, etc.  The only monthly debt payments I have personally totals $340, excluding housing. Including my housing it is $1,099. I do not have any credit card debt, no collections, and no bankruptcies. Conventional banks do not help people that are in my unique situation. My business is a cash business, and I have not applied for a lot of credit accounts, and the banks look down on that. I do not have a lot of open credit accounts because I do not really believe in credit cards.  I like to pay cash if I have it and that way I avoid getting into debt. I have been very responsible with credit and do not like to just open up accounts for the heck of it. Apparently this is not something that banks like, because they are saying that I do not have a lot of credit accounts. I only have 3 but that is enough for me. They want people to open up so many accounts so that you can drown in debt, but I have steered clear of that scenario. Please help me further my business venture because banks are not willing to help someone with a unique situation like me even though I have good credit scores. ",-1

Now that I have regained my strength after chemo and radiation I have the energy to get these bills paid off!!  I battled cancer for a year without taking any time off from work because I am very lucky to have a career that is not physically straining and I knew I needed to keep from drowning in doctor bills.  I am a very dependable person, I have paid off many accounts in my past including 3 new car loans.  My credit has been dropping because of unpaid doctor bills and too many maxed out credit cards in the last couple of years.  I am trying to dig myself out of a hole that keeps caving in.  My dad always said don???t get credit cards, I wish I would have listened!  If I could get this loan thru LendingClub I would pay off 4 credit cards with rates over 20%, two doctor bills and a timeshare loan and get myself out of debt in 3 years at the most but hopefully sooner.  Please help me be debt free faster!  Without the LendingClub loan I feel like I might be in debt to these companies forever.

While the rate is slightly higher than the current combined rate of the debt it will cover,  It will cut monthly payment by about $100 and will improve my credit score by getting rid of several credit cards.<br/> Borrower added on 10/01/11 > I want to again address the fact that part of what I plan to pay with this loan is a car loan at a significantly lower rate. Let me explain what our goal is. We plan to purchase a home sometime in the next year and a half to two years. This loan will reduce the amount of overall payments we have allowing us to save more for a down-payment. It will also improve our credit by reducing our credit card debt, making easier for us to get the loan. Along the same lines it will make it possible to for us to get a car loan at a better rate in 6 or 12 months and pay part of this loan off if we so choose.<br/><br/>I feel that I am fairly knowledgeable about credit in general and we have never had late payments. Which brings me to something else I should probably discuss. How we got this credit card debt in the first place. <br/><br/>We have moved three time in the last 3 years. First so I could finish school, then once I graduated we moved back to the town we had moved from and recently for me to take a job relating to my degree.<br/>",-1

"It is my goal to make this loan as safe as possible for you while meeting my needs!  I am seeking $9,000 to replace the capital I used for a recent real estate purchase.  I managed to negotiate a deal on an 800 sq. ft. one bedroom house that needs minimal repair for $8,500 cash. The additional $500 will cover my closing costs and some of the very minor repair work that is needed.  This property will not have a mortgage against it because the loan amount would be so small.  This home was previously rented for $450, which is what I plan on asking for it.  My insurance, taxes, and management costs will run about $125, which leaves $325 to cover the cost of my loan at about $287 per month.    In the event that the unit is vacant I can easily cover the payment from my other rental income (net $900/month) or from my salary (net $4,700/month).

"My reputation as a cinematographer is on the rise.  I'm am currently shooting two feature length independent films.  These films are not being shot on High Definition, but all subsequent films will need to be.  Therefore, I must upgrade my camera to HD, as well. The camera I've chosen allows for interchangeable lenses.  Having this camera will bring me more assignments due to the camera's versatility, ability to shoot using cinemagraphic lenses and my practical experience with the feature films that I have worked on already.   I base this on the fact that I noted an increase in business when I upgraded in 2005 to a camera that was capable of shooting 23.98 frames-per-second.     Being able to offer shooting-plus-editing packages to clients at reasonable rates is a strength in the current economic environment.  After eight years of experience in my field, the projects of my client base are growing, becoming longer and more involved.  I've gone from 10-20 minute projects (documentary, promo's, PSA's, ads, music videos) to feature length indie film and DVD projects. These projects require more processing speed and hard drive space than the Mac G4 I've been using can handle.  I am able to pull together funding on my own to upgrade my computer, which will allow me handle more than one large project at once, and to author DVD's for my clients from the projects I edit-- better and more efficient for my clients, and more income per project for me ($1000-3000 more per project.)  I work with a diverse mixture of clients -- from educational institutes to documentary producers, up-and-coming African directors, small businesses, corporate clients, production companies, rappers, rockers and other entertainers-- and have built my business using much of the same gear and software I bought will still in school.

I am currently seeking a loan for education credits in order to increase my current salary. My bank is willing to give me this small personal loan at almost a 13% fixed interest rate. Rather than have to pay the bank the additional interest I am looking into peer-to-peer lending here at LendingClub for the funds. Monthly payments should be low over a 3 year period so I have absolutely no problem in paying it back. I take great pride in maintaining good credit so that one day I may purchase a home. This is my first time getting a peer-to-peer loan online and look forward to investing in the future.   Thank you all for your support.,-1
